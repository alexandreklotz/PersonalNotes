## Domain 1 - Security and Risk Management

__Basics__

__ALE__ : Annualized Loss Expectancy => ALE = SLE * ARO

> The cost you should expect every year because of a particular risk is the Annualized Loss Expectancy.

__AV__ : Asset Value (See Deloitte's approach for intangible assets).

__EF__ : Exposure Factor

__SLE__ : Single Loss Expectancy => SLE = AV * EF

__ARO__ : Annual Rate of Occurence

__TCO__ : Total Cost of Ownership.

> Total Cost of Ownership is the total cost of owning an asset for a period of time, including the cost of the asset as well as the cost of mitigating risks to the asset.


__Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Impact__ (can also be only Threat * Vulnerability).

__Legal matters__

> Enticement occurs when an individual who was already planning to commit a crime is eventually lured into doing so at the urging of law enforcement. A companion concept to enticement is entrapment, which occurs when an individual who otherwise had no intention of committing a crime is lured into doing so at the urging of law enforcement. 

A corporate legal team investigating the potentially malicious actions of a competitor is an example of a civil investigation. There are four types of investigations that will likely be encountered by most security administrators :
* Civil investigations
* Criminal investigations
* Administrative investigations
* Regulatory investigations

Civil investigations attempt to resolve disputes between two parties, such as private individuals or corporate entities. Although civil investigations ultimately involve the court system to resolve disputes, they do not depend on the *beyond a reasonable doubt* standard of proof. Instead, because the judgements that stems from civil cases are typically in the form of monetary compensation, civil investigations depend merely on the *preponderance of evidence* standard of proof, which is a significantly easier bar to achieve compared to the *beyond a reasonable doubt* standard of proof.

By contrast, criminal investigations are typically conducted by law enforcement personnel and attempt to determine whether a criminal law has been violated. For example, a sheriff's deputy investigating a theft from a corporate warehouse is an example of criminal investigation. Because criminal investigations can result in judgements such as probation and incarceration, they depend on the *beyond a reasonable doubt* standard of proof. This standard of proof requires a strict chain of evidence that implicates the accused without the possibility of an alternate explanation or interpretation of the presented evidence.

Regulatory investigations attempt to determine whether an administrative law or industry standard has been violated. For example, a third-party auditor investigating the adherence of a business to an industry standard is an example of a regulatory investigation. The investigation of administrative law violations is generally handled by the government agency or regulatory body that is responsible for the enforcement of the particular administrative law that has been violated. However, the investigation of the violation of industry standards does not typically involve government agencies because the standards are contractual agreements between organizations rather than administrative law. The investigations of the violation of industry standards is often conducted by a third-party auditor who can determine whether any contractual standards were violated and to what extent the violator should be fined or otherwise sanctioned.

Administrative investigations are internal investigations that attempt to determine whether organizational policies or operational procedures have been violated. For example, a human resources officer investigating the expense reports submitted by a mobile worker is an example of an administrative investigation. Operational procedures are typically investigated to resolve issues, such as reduced system performance or limited network resource availability. Because the purpose of an operational investigation is to gather enough information to mitigate the operational issue, it has the loosest standards for the collection of information compared to other common types of investigation. By contrast, administrative investigations typically have a higher standard for the collection of information because administrative investigations can ultimately result in sanctions against internal personnel for violations of organizational policies.

>__Important things to know/check for the exam__ : USA Patriot Act, US Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), US Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). Questions will probably be asked about these.

<br>

__Risk assessment__ : Risk assessment determines possible mishaps, their likelihood and consequences, and the tolerances for such events. The results of this process may be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative fashion. Risk assessment is an inherent part of a broader risk management strategy to help reduce any potential risk-related consequences. More precisely, risk assessment identifies and analyses potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e. hazard analysis). It also makes judgments "on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors (i.e. risk evaluation)


__Difference between Qualitative and Quantitative risk assessment__ :
>Assessors would be more likely to perform a qualitative risk assessment when the assessors do not have much time to perform the risk assessment.
* __Qualitative__ :
    * They do not require a lot of numerical data
    * They provide results that are descriptive rather than measurable
    * They are easier to perform and require less time than quantitative risk assessment
    * They are recommended for assessors who do not have much experience performing risk assessments but have extensive experience with the systems and business processes.
* __Quantitative__ :
    * They require numerical data
    * They provide results that are measurable
    * They are more difficult to perform and require more time than qualitative risk assessment
    * They are recommended only for assessors who have extensive experience performing risk assessments.

>Regardless of whether the assessors perform a qualitative or quantitative risk assessment, they must first have the full support of management. During the assessment process, the assessors should keep management informed. After the assessment is complete, the assessors can propose to management any countermeasures that should be implemented to mitigate risk.

<br>

__NIST SP 800-30__ : *(See the PDF file in the local folder)* is used to assess risk. Risk assessment is performed to identify, analyze and quantify the risks a business faces. This helps companies understand how to address these risks in the most cost efficient and practical manner. The following methodologies are used to assess risk :
* __NIST SP 800-30__ - establishes a nine-step method for assessing risk
* __NIST SP 800-66__ - is similar to SP 800-30 but was written specifically for healthcare organizations that must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
* __[CCTA Risk Analysis and Management Method (CRAMM)](https://riskpublishing.com/cramm-risk-assessment/)__ - establishes a three-stage approach to risk evaluation that analyzes technical as well as nontechnical security aspects
* __Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP)__ - is a low-cost method of evaluating risk for one system or process at a time
* __Security Officers Management and Analysis Project (SOMAP)__ - is an open-source method for evaluating and managing risk
* __Spanning Tree Analysis__ - creates a tree of all possible threats and prunes branches that do not apply to an asset
* __Value at Risk (VAR)__ - identifies a profile of acceptable risk for a company in order to determine the most cost-effective risk mitigation method.

>NIST SP 800-30 does not establish security management best practices, baseline for IT ethics or protect intellectual property. 

The following are used to establish security management best practices :
* __IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)__ : is a methodology created by the Central Computer and Telecommunication Agency (CCTA) for the UK government that is focused on improving IT service management processes
* __Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT)__ : is an Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) framework that establishes 34 processes and 214 control objectives to assist in developing an IT security management plan
* __International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000__ : establishes a framework for developing security management standards
* __NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)__ : is a security compliance framework for government entities

The following are used to protect intellectual property :
* __Code of Fair Information Practices__ : establishes a baseline for the ethical handling of personal information
* __Internet Activities Board (IAB)__ : establishes standards for unethical behavior on the Internet
* __Computers Ethics Institute (CEI)__ : created the Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics
* __National Conference on Computing and Values (NCCV)__ : proposed four values for computing security
* __Working Group on Computer Ethics__ : created the End User's Basic Tenets of Responsible Computing
* __National Computer Ethics and Responsibilities Campaign (NCERC)__ : promotes awareness of computer ethics programs
* __International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC²) Code of Ethics__ : creates an ethical standard for certified professionals to follow

The following are used to protect intellectual property :
* __Copyrights__ : protect art, music, literature or source code from being used by a third-party without a license or explicit permission from the owner of the intellectual property
* __Trademarks__ : protect branding, such as a slogan, a logo or other means of creating a distinction between a product that is produced by one company and a similar product that is produced by a competitor
* __Patents__ : protect the patent holder's exclusive rights to use, create or sell an invention for a specific period of time
* __Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)__ : are used to dissuade an individual from revealing trade secrets or other confidential information to third parties

__Data management roles__ :
* __[Data owner](https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-france/post/quest-ce-quun-data-owner)__ : sometimes called the information owner or the business owner, is responsible for classifying data. A data owner is typically a manager who maintains responsibility for the security of a particular information asset. Sensitivity labels are assigned to each asset by the data owner; a sensitivity label ensures that the data is accessible only by users who possess the appropriate level of clearance. Over time, sensitive data might lose its sensitivity. Therefore, data owners should review their data's classification at least annually, and any data that is no longer sensitive should be declassified.
* __[Data custodian](https://www.oracle.com/fr/database/definition-data-steward/)__ : sometimes called the data steward, is responsible for the hands-on protection of data. For example, a data custodian is typically responsible for data backups, network and endpoint security, systems maintenance, and disaster recovery (DR). Although the data custodian might make basic decisions regarding how to implement security, the data owner makes the high-level security decisions and the data custodian carries out those decisions.

>Senior management is responsible for ensuring that all of a company's assets, both physical and logical, are protected. The company's security program must be funded and staffed through the decisions and actions made by them. The end users are responsible for protecting the data that they access on a daily basis by following the company's policies/procedures/standards.



__Service account__: If a service or daemon requires login credentials to function, you should create a separate user account for the service or daemon; this user account is called a service account.

__Security program / policy__:

Policies provide a high-level overview of a company's security posture, creating the basic framework upon which a company's security program is based. A comprehensive security program includes the following components :
* Policies
* Procedures
* Standards
* Baselines
* Guidelines

A well-formed policy should include the following four elements :
* Purpose - The reason the policy exists
* Scope - The entities that are covered by the policy
* Responsibilities - The things that covered individuals must do to comply with the policy
* Compliance - How to measure the effectiveness of the policy and the consequences for violating the policy

When creating a policy, you should not be too specific, because the methods for implementing the policy will change over time. In addition, the policy should not be too technical, because the technologies that will be covered under the policy will also change over time. By avoiding specific and technical terms, you will ensure that the policy can survive without updates for a longer period of time.

| Document | Example | Mandatory/Discretionary |
---|---|---
Policy | Protect the CIA of PII by hardening the OS | Mandatory
Procedure | Step 1: Install prehardened image, Step 2... | Mandatory
Standard | Use Nexus-6 laptop HW | Mandatory
Guideline | Patch installation may be automated by script | Discretionary
Baselines | Use the CIS security benchmark windows benchmark | Discretionary

<br>

__Types of access control__ : 
* __Directive__ : are used to define appropriate use and behavior within an organization with regard to that organization's systems and services. For example, some companies require employees to sign an acceptable use policy that defines the fonctions employees are allowed to perform with the company's equipment before the employees will be granted access to the equipment.
* __Deterrent__ : are used to dissuade potential attacks. For example, a sign on the exterior of a building that warns potential attackers about the presence of an alarm system and monitoring is a deterrent access control. A company policy that threatens termination of users who surf inappropriate sites on the web is also a deterrent access control.
* __Preventive__ : are used to stop potential attacks by preventing users from performing specific actions or functions on a system. A company that requires a pre-employment drug screening prevents the employment of a person who uses illegal drugs. Therefore, mandating a pre-employment drug screening is a preventive access control.
* __Compensating__ : are used to supplement directive access control. For example, an administrator who regularly examines network traffic logs to look for violations of the company's internet usage policy is acting as a compensating access control to the directive access control that is the policy itself.
* __Detective__ : are used to monitor or to send alerts about malicious activity. For example, a CCTV camera can record video of people entering and exiting a building at specific times of the day. The feed from the CCTV camera can be monitored in real-time by a security guard or recorded for later review.
* __Corrective__ : are used to repair damage caused by malicious events. For example, antivirus software that can take corrective action to repair damage caused by a virus.
* __Recovery__ : are typically used to restore a system to a normal state after malicious activity has occurred. A data backup system that is used to restore damaged or lost data to a server is an example of a recovery access control.
>These access control types can fall into one of three categories: administrative, technical, or physical. <br>1. Administrative (also called directive) controls are implemented by creating and following organizational policy, procedure, or regulation. User training and awareness also fall into this category.<br> 2. Technical controls are implemented using software, hardware, or firmware that restricts logical access on an IT system. Examples include firewalls, routers, encryption, etc. <br>3. Physical controls are implemented with physical devices, such as locks, fences, gates, and security guards.

<br>

__[GDPR/RGPD](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A8glement_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral_sur_la_protection_des_donn%C3%A9es)__:
Created in 2016 to replace the EU Data Protection Directive. It ensures the protection of information for individuals in EU member nations. The EU requires that, all organizations, whether or not they are based in the EU, adhere to the provisions of the GDPR. The GDPR contains the following provisions :
* Companies must inform authorities of major data breaches within 72 hours.
* Each EU member nation must create a centralized data protection authority.
* Individuals must have access to their own data.
* Information regarding an individual must be transferrable to another service provider at the individual's request.
* Individuals retain "the right to be forgotten" and have their information deleted if it is no longer required.
* Organizations located outside the EU must adhere to the GDPR if they collect information about EU residents.

<br>

__Types of alternate sites (in case of disaster for example)__

* __Cold site__:
A cold site is a backup facility with little or no hardware equipment installed. A cold site is essentially an office space with basic utilities such as power, cooling system, air conditioning, and communication equipment, etc. A cold site is the most cost-effective option among the three disaster recovery sites. However, due to the fact that a cold site doesn’t have any pre-installed equipment, it takes a lot of time to properly set it up so as to fully resume business operations. In case of a disaster, an organization would require help from IT personnel to migrate necessary servers and make them functional in order to take on the workload of the primary site.

* __Warm site__:
A warm site is considered the middle ground between the cold site and the hot site. A warm site is a backup facility that has the network connectivity and the necessary hardware equipment already pre-installed. However, a warm site cannot perform on the same level as the production center because they are not equipped in the same way. Therefore, a warm site has less operational capacity than the primary site. Moreover, data synchronization between the primary and the secondary sites is performed daily or weekly, which can result in minor data loss. A warm site is perfect for organizations which operate with less critical data and can tolerate a short period of downtime.

* __Hot site__:
A hot site is a backup facility which represents a mirrored copy of the primary production center. A hot site is equipped with all the necessary hardware, software, and network connectivity, which allows you to perform near real-time backup or replication of the critical data. This way the production workload can be failed over to a DR site in a few minutes or hours, thus ensuring minimal downtime and zero data loss. A hot site is expected to be always online and running without disruption so as to ensure data synchronization between the sites.
It is important to ensure that this type of a DR site is located far enough from the production center. This way you can decrease the possibility of a hot site being affected by the same disaster as the primary site.


* __Mutual Assistance Agreement (MAA)__:
A Mutual Assistance Agreement or MAA is an arrangement between two or more companies such that each will assist the other in the event of a disaster, typically by sharing computing resources.
Care should be taken in such agreements to ensure that the two companies are unlikely to be victims of the same disaster. e.g. they should not be too physically close to each other or lie on the same earthquake fault zone.

__MAA__ is the most cost effective alternate site solution when planning for the possibility of a disaster. It is a legal arrangement between two companies in which the parties accept to aid one another by providing space and network resources in the event that a disaster renders one of the parties incapable of functioning at its own location. These agreements can be cost effective and beneficial, especially if the two organizations are similar and in close proximity.
There are significant drawbacks to using an MAA :
* Sharing resources can expose a company's confidential data
* Since it is a legal agreement, both organizations must provide as much detail as possible about how the arrangement should work. For example, an agreement that does not define the conditions of disaster and the condition of being nonfunctional could enable one company to refuse to honor the MAA.
* Close proximity requirement could also be a drawback since both companies could be affected by the same disaster.

## Domain 2 - Asset Security

__Clearance__ : Formal determination of whether a user can be trusted with a specific level of information. Must determine the subject's current and potential future trustworthiness (the latter is harder and more expensive). Some higher level clearances include access to compartmented information. Comparmentalization is a technical method for enforcing need to know. 

__Formal access approval__ : documented approval from a data owner for a subject to access certain objects. Requires the user to understand rules and requirements.

__Certification and accreditation__ : 
* A __certification__ for a system means that the system has been certified to meet the security requirements of the data owner. It considers the system, security measures taken to protect it, and the residual risk represented by the system.
* __Accreditation__ is the data owner's acceptance of the certification and of the residual risk, which is required before the system is put into production.

__Electronic Medical Records (EMR)__ : You must stop using the legacy EMR application when the application fails and cannot be repaired. The primary risk of using older software/hardware is the cost of support when a failure event occurs. You should attempt to migrate to newer hardware or software before the older hardware/software reaches End Of Life (EOL), End Of Support (EOS) or End Of Service Life (EOSL).

__Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF)__ : sometimes known as CSRF, is a web based attack. It is the least likely to be mitigated by using input validation and sanitization. It can be mitigated by CAPTCHA.

__[Security Marking](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)__ : Security marking reflects applicable laws, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. These markings enable organizational process–based enforcement of security policies. Security marking is generally not required for information in the public domain; however, some organizations require markings for publicly releasable information.

Although security marking and security labeling are related and the two terms are often used interchangeably, they are different. Security marking refers to the use of human-readable security attributes. Security labeling refers to the use of security attributes for internal data structures within information systems. Security labeling helps to enable information system–based enforcement of security policies. Each organization can define the attributes that are needed to support the organization's mission or business functions. 

Security labels can be used to control access to information. For example, an access control list (ACL) can specify which devices, users, or clearance levels can gain access to the data. Security labels can also be used to indicate how information must be handled by the information system. For example, a data life cycle attribute can specify how long data must be retained or backed up, typically in accordance with legal requirements.

__[Vs of Big Data](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.1500-4.pdf)__ : is an umbrella term that is commonly used to describe the large amount of data that is processed by systems and networks in the modern age. Because scientific and technological advancements have not kept up with the amount of data in the modern age that is available for processing and analysis, most Big Data analysis occurs by using samples of data instead of the full range. One way to think about this form of Big Data analysis is in terms of surveys and polls, which attempt to calculate the majority of public opinion by taking information from a small sampling of the population. There are four common Vs of Big Data as noted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 1500-4: variety, volume, velocity, and variability. Variety describes data source types, such as whether the data is structured, unstructured, or partially structured. Volume describes how much data is inbound and processed. Velocity describes the speed at which data is inbound and processed. Variability is the process of correctly interpreting the meanings of raw data. There are also other sub-characteristics that are also commonly described as Vs of Big Data; these include veracity, validity, and volatility. The total number of Vs of Big Data as well as their definitions can vary by source. NIST Special Publication 1500-4 is one instance of an attempt to define and organize information about Big Data as it pertains to privacy and security.

## Domain 3 - Security Architecture and Engineering

__Sprinkler systems__ :
* __Wet pipes__ have water right up to the sprinkler heads; therefore, the pipes are “wet.” 
The sprinkler head contains a metal, which is common in older sprinklers, or small glass bulb designed to melt or break at a specific temperature. Once that occurs, the sprinkler head opens and water flows. Each head will open independently as the trigger temperature is exceeded.
* __Dry pipe__ systems also have closed sprinkler heads, but the difference is compressed air fills the pipes. A valve holds the water back and it will remain closed as long as sufficient air pressure remains in the pipes. As the dry pipe sprinkler heads open, the air pressure drops in each pipe, allowing the valve to open and send water to that head.
* __Deluge systems__ are similar to dry pipes, except the sprinkler heads are open and 
larger than dry pipe heads. The pipes are empty at normal air pressure; a deluge valve 
holds the water back. The valve opens when a fire alarm triggers.
* __Preaction__ systems are a combination of wet, dry, or deluge systems and require two separate triggers to release water. Single interlock systems release water into the pipes when a fire alarm triggers. The water releases once the head opens. Double interlock systems use compressed air, the same as dry pipes. However, the water will not fill the pipes until both the fire alarm triggers and the sprinkler head opens.

__Classes of fire and suppression agents__

| __US Class__ | __EU Class__ | __Material__ | __Suppression Agent__
---|---|---|---
A | A | Ordinary combustibles, wood/paper | Water/soda acid
B | B | Liquid | Halon/Halon substitute, CO²1 or soda acid
B | C | Flammable gasses | Halon/Halon substitute, CO²1 or soda acid
C | E | Electrical equipment | Halon/Halon substitute, CO²
D | D | Combustible metals | Dry powder
K | F | Kitchen (oil or fat) fires | Wet chemicals

<br>

> Halon is being replaced by argon, FE-13, FM-200, and Inergen; these agents are called halon replacements. Halon is harmful to the environment because it contributes to ozone depletion. Therefore, halon has been banned by the 1989 Montreal Protocol. Halon replacements work similarly to halon but do not contribute to ozone depletion. Halon works by using a chemical reaction that lowers the temperature of the fire and removes fuel from the fire. Unlike CO², halon replacements do not remove oxygen from the area and does not, therefore, suffocate humans. Of the available halon replacements, FE-13 is the safest for humans, which can be safely breathed at concentrations of up to 24 percent. FM-200 can be safely breathed at concentrations of up to 9 percent, which is above its effective concentration of 7 percent.

<br>

__Database security__ :
Databases present unique security challenges. The sheer amount of data that may be 
housed in a database requires special security consideration. As we will see shortly 
in the “Inference and Aggregation” section, the logical connections database users 
may make by creating, viewing, and comparing records may lead to inference and 
aggregation attacks, requiring database security precautions such as inference controls and polyinstantiation.
* __Polyinstantiation__ : allows two different objects to have the same name. The word polyinstantiation is based on the Latin roots for multiple (poly) and instances (instantiation). Database polyinstantiation means two rows may have the same primary key, but different data.
* __Inference and aggregation__ : occur when a user is able to use lower-level access to learn restricted information. These issues occur in multiple realms, including database security. Inference requires deduction. There is a mystery to be solved, and lower level details provide the clues. Aggregation is a mathematical process; a user asks every question, receives every answer and derives restricted information.
* __Data mining__ : searches large amounts of data to determine patterns that would otherwise get *"lost in the noise"*. Credit card issuers have become experts in data mining, searching millions of credit card transactions stored in their databases to discover signs of fraud. Simple data mining rules, such as *"X or more purchases, in Y time, in Z places"* are useful in discovering stolen credit cards.

Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) is the SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) component that provides a language for specifying security checklists. SCAP is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard protocol that provides common sets of criteria for defining and assessing security vulnerabilities that are found in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

SCAP includes all of the following components :
* __CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure)__, which defines the naming system for describing vulnerabilities
* __CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)__, which defines a standard scoring system for vulnerability severity
* __CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration)__, which defines a naming system for system configuration problems
* __CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)__,  which defines an operating system, application, and device naming system
* __XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format)__, which defines a language format for security checklists
* __OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)__, which defines a language format for security testing procedures

Applications that conform to SCAP can therefore scan and score systems according to a standard set of criteria. In addition, these applications can communicate with each other in a standard fashion.

The /etc/shadow file is a Linux system file that contains secure user account information and can be read only by root, which is also known as the superuser. The following fields are present in /etc/shadow and are separated by colons:
* Login name
* Encrypted password
* Last password change date
* Minimum password age
* Maximum password age
* Password warning period
* Password inactivity period
* Account expiration date
* Reserved field

Like /etc/shadow, the /etc/passwd file is a Linux system file that can contain user account information in much older systems. However, the /etc/passwd file is not secure; although the passwords in /etc/passwd are encrypted, all users have read permission to /etc/passwd. To migrate the passwords from /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow, you should issue the __pwconv__  command. The following fields are present in /etc/passwd and are separated by colons:
* Login name
* Encrypted password
* User ID (UID)
* User's primary group id (GID)
* General Electric Comprehensive Operating System (GECOS) field
* User's home directory
* Shell program to run at login

The /etc/gshadow file is a Linux system file that contains secure group account information and cannot be read by regular users. The following fields are present in /etc/gshadow and are separated by colons:
* Group name
* Encrypted password
* Comma-delimited list of administrators
* Comma-delimited list of group members

Like /etc/gshadow, the /etc/group file is a Linux system file that contains group account information. However, the /etc/group file is not secure; although the passwords in /etc/group are encrypted, all users have read permission to /etc/group. To migrate the passwords from /etc/group to /etc/gshadow, you should issue the __grpconv__  command. The following fields are present in /etc/group and are separated by colons:
* Group name
* Encrypted password
* GID
* Comma-delimited list of group members

__Difference between Multiprocessing/Multithreading/Multitasking/Pipelining__

__Multiprocessing__ : Multiple CPUs sharing the processing load of a single system. Multiprocessing divides a workstation or server's load amont multiple CPUs. When more than one CPU in installed in a system, the system's OS is able to distribute the system's workload so that multiple tasks are being processed on multiple CPUs. Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems use a single OS to manage every CPU that is installed in the system. Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) systems use a separate OS installation per CPU.

__Multitasking__ : A CPU switching from one process to another to speed up processing time is an example of multitasking. Multitasking divides CPU time among multiple processes, or tasks. A task is given a slice of CPU time. The CPU processes the task for the given amount of time and then moves on to another task. When all tasks have been given a slice of time, the CPU returns to the first task for another given amount of time and continues the cycle until the task is complete. Although only one task is actually being processed during a given slice of time, the slices are of such short duration that a user is given the impression that the tasks are being processed simultaneously.

__Multithreading__ : A CPU dividing time between child processes is an example of multithreading. A process is an application. Processes can spawn child processes that are known as threads. Multithreading OSs divide CPU time between the threads. Although only one thread is actually being processed during a given slice of time, the slices are of such short duration that a user is given the impression that the threads are being processed simultaneously.

__Pipelining__ : A CPU fetching a new instruction while decoding another instruction is an example of pipelining. Pipelining is a method by which a CPU can process more than one instruction per clock cycle. A four-stage pipeline enables the CPU to process four instructions in different stages per clock cycle. When pipelining is used, the CPU can process an instruction in one stage of the cycle while processing a different instruction in each of the three other stages. For example, once an instruction moves from the fetch stage to the decode stage, a new instruction can be fetched. When the first instruction moves into the execute phase, the second instruction can move into the decode stage and a third instruction can be fetched. When the first instruction moves into the write stage, the second instruction moves into the execute stage. The third instruction then moves into the decode stage, and a fourth instruction is fetched.

__Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)__ : The Base score affects the Temporal score, and the Temporal score affects the Environmental score. Therefore, the Environmental score is the final score that an end-user organization should use in order to prioritize responses to vulnerabilities.

The CVSS is an open standard that helps to indicate the severity of vulnerabilities and to prioritize responses to those vulnerabilities. Maintained by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the CVSS was collaboratively created by several organizations, including the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERT/CC), Cisco, eBay, Microsoft, and Symantec.

CVSS scoring is influenced by three metric groups: Base metrics, Temporal metrics, and Environmental metrics. Base metrics, which indicate the severity of the vulnerability, are established by the vendor or originator and have the largest influence on the final CVSS score. Temporal metrics, which indicate the urgency of the vulnerability, are also established by the vendor or originator and can change over time. Environmental metrics are optional and indicate how much an environment or end-user organization is affected by a vulnerability; therefore, the Environmental metrics are established by each end-user organization.

__[VMEscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine_escape)__ => To read.

__DEP/ASLR__ : One of the main goals in attempting to exploit software vulnerabilities is to achieve some form of code execution capability. The two most prominent protections against 
this attack are data execution prevention (DEP) and address space location randomization (ASLR). DEP, which can be enabled within hardware and/or software, attempts to prevent code execution in memory locations that are not predefined to contain executable content. Another protection mechanism, ASLR, seeks to make exploitation more difficult by randomizing memory addresses. For example, imagine an adversary develops a successful working exploit on his or her own test machine. When the code is run on a different system using ASLR, the addresses will change, which will probably cause the exploit to fail.

__[CISC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocesseur_%C3%A0_jeu_d%27instruction_%C3%A9tendu) and [RISC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processeur_%C3%A0_jeu_d%27instructions_r%C3%A9duit)__ : CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) and RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) are two forms of CPU design. CISC uses a large set of complex machine language instructions, while RISC uses a reduced set of simpler instructions. x86 CPUs, among many others, are CISC; ARM (used in many cellphones and PDAs), PowerPC, Sparc, and others are RISC.

__[Common Criteria (CC) Security Target (ST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria)__ : A CC ST is the documentation for a system or product that is to be tested. The CC is an international standard that is used to test the security of IT products; it uses a hierarchy of current state-of-the-art requirements to test security. The goal of the CC is to identify and remove known vulnerabilities from a product rather than to discover new vulnerabilities. The CC testing process breaks down into the following four terms :
* __Target of Evaluation (ToE)__ : The system or product that is to be tested.
* __ST__ : the documentation that describes the ToE and any security requirements.
* __Protection Profile (PP)__ : a set of security requirements and objects for the type of product to be tested
* __Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)__ : a rating level that is assigned to the product after the product has been tested.

EALs are further broken down into the following seven ratings :
* __EAL1__ : Functionally tested
* __EAL2__ : Structurally tested
* __EAL3__ : Methodically tested and checked
* __EAL4__ : Methodically designed, tested and reviewed
* __EAL5__ : Semi-formally designed and tested
* __EAL6__ : Semi-formally verified, designed and tested
* __EAL7__ : Formally verified, designed and tested

__[Department of Defense (DoD) standard for network security evaluation (red book)](https://irp.fas.org/nsa/rainbow.htm)__ : Red Book, which is also known as the Trusted Network Interpretation, is a U.S. DoD standard that describes security evaluation criteria for networked systems. Red Book is a supplement to Orange Book, which is also known as the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) method of security evaluation. The TCSEC security evaluation method was created by the U.S. DoD in the 1980s. TCSEC defines different types of access controls within a computer system, but it does not attempt to define access controls in terms of a network. Therefore, Red Book was created to address network security. TCSEC includes the following four divisions of security, where A is the highest form of security and D is the lowest:

1. Verified Protection
2. Mandatory Protection
3. Discretionary Protection
4. Minimal Protection

Division D contains systems that do not meet the security requirements of the other divisions. Division C contains systems that use discretionary access control (DAC) forms of security. Division B contains systems that use mandatory access control (MAC) forms of security. Finally, Division A contains systems that use the MAC forms of security from Division B as well as additional security measures. Divisions are further broken down into numbered categories that more accurately describe the system's method of access control, with higher numbers indicating more secure systems. For example, a system that is rated B3 is a system that has implemented security domains; this system would be considered more secure than a system that is rated B2, which is a system that has implemented structured protection. Although the TCSEC method is no longer in use, it is the model for other security evaluation methods, such as ITSEC.

__ITIL__ : ITIL is an operational framework that was developed in the 1980s by the CCTA for the government of the United Kingdom. ITIL standardizes IT management procedures. ITIL provides documentation on IT best practices that can improve performance, increase productivity, and reduce costs. ITIL is divided into the following five main tasks :
* __Service strategy__ describes how new business needs will be deployed and managed
* __Service design__ is the process of designing the services that were described in the service strategy
* __Service transition__ uses a project management structure to transition from design into operation
* __Service operations__ is the point at which all services are deployed to users and metrics are being captured
* __Continual service improvement__ uses the metrics from the service operations task to determine what improvements need to be made to the system

<br>

__Trusted Computing base (TCB)__ : is the term that best describes all components of a system that are responsible for system security. The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) states that a system component is part of the TCB only if that component was designed to provide security to the system as a whole. For example, an operating system's kernel and the supporting programs that configure file ownership and permissions are TCB components. Because large and complex systems are less likely to be secure than small and simple systems, system architects typically attempt to create small TCBs. 

The TCB is a component of TCSEC. Therefore, TCSEC relies on TCB to describe all the components of a system that are responsible for system security. However, TCSEC does describe the elements of a system that can be included in the TCB. The TCSEC security evaluation method was created by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1980s. TCSEC, which is also known as the Orange Book, defines different types of access controls within a computer system but does not attempt to define access controls in terms of a network.

The Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) security evaluation method does not describe all the components of a system that are responsible for system security. The ITSEC security evaluation method is a European set of security evaluation criteria that is based on TCSEC and is used internationally. ITSEC is different from TCSEC in that it segregates a system's functionality, which is also known as F, from the ability to evaluate the system's security, which is also known as assurance.

The International Common Criteria security evaluation method does not describe all the components of a system that are responsible for system security. The International Common Criteria is an international standard that is used to test the security of IT products. The International Common Criteria uses a hierarchy of current state-of-the-art requirements to test security. The goal of the International Common Criteria is to identify and remove known vulnerabilities from a product rather than to discover new vulnerabilities.

__[TPM / Trusted Platform Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-r2-and-2008/cc730635(v=ws.11))__ : is an independent cryptographic processor embedded into computers. A TPM provides hardware-based authentication and full disk encryption services. Because the encryption keys are stored in the TPM, any data stored on the drive cannot be decrypted once the drive is removed from the original device. Two difference keys are used by the TPM hardware : an __endorsement key__ and a __root storage key__. The endorsement key is created when the TPM is manufactured and is permanent. The root storage key is created when a user takes ownership of the TPM. TPM uses an encrypted memory module, which provides an additional security layer for properties such as passwords, digital certificates and encryption keys, such as those with public key infrastructure (PKI) keys. A TPM can be used to improve protection for various services such as wireless network encryption, file encryption, virtual private network (VPN) encryption and password management.

__[Network topologies](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/prime/fulfillment/6-1/user/guide/prime_fulfill/diagnostics_vpn.pdf)__ :
* __hub and spoke__ requires that all communications pass through a central device (a good example is early plain old telephone system (POTS) configurations)
* __partial mesh__ does not require that all communications pass through a central device; redundant paths exist between some but not all, of the devices of the network. Because some devices in this topology do not have redundant connections to other devices on the network, a certain degreee of redundancy is compromised. However, the scalability of the network is proportionately increased because each device on the network is not required to have a connection to every other device
* __point-to-point__ is a simple topology that connects one network node to another network node by using a single direct link. It only supports two network nodes and therefore cannot be implemented on large networks
* __full-mesh__ is a topology in which each device is required to have a direct connection to every other device on the network. This requirement enables a full-mesh topology to provide optimal redudancy and routing between devices on the network. However, this requirement limits the scalability of the topology because each new device on the network will require a connection to every existing device.

__[Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)](https://www.cloudflare.com/fr-fr/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/)__ : In the case of a GRE packet being delivered by IPv4, the destination IP address will be contained in the packet's delivery header (if delivered by IPv4).

__[Authentication header](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication_Header)__ : is not a transport encryption protocol and is therefore not used to provide confidentiality of information transmitted over an [L2TP tunnel](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol). However, AH is a component of the [IPSec](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) suite that provides authentication and integrity. Therefore, AH and ESP work together to provide authentication, integrity and confidentiality over a tunnel. AH is typically used with [ESP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec#Encapsulating_Security_Payload) in transport mode.

__[SSL](https://www.kaspersky.fr/resource-center/definitions/what-is-a-ssl-certificate)__ : is not typically used to provide confidentiality of information transmitted over an L2TP tunnel. It has been used however to provide confidentiality for information transmitted between a browser and a web server.

__[TLS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)__ : is not typically used to provide confidentiality of information transmitted over an L2TP tunnel. TLS is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) transport encryption protocol that was designed to replace SSL after weaknesses were discovered in SSL. 

__[3DES](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES)__ : Despite a 168-bit key length, the effective security of 3DES is 112 bits. The weakness of 3DES is that it is susceptible to the meet-in-the-middle attack, which is a known plaintext attack. Commonly used against Double DES (2DES), the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to extract encryption keys when the plaintext and matching ciphertext are known. 2DES encrypts by using two 56-bit keys. A malicious user will generate every possible value for the first key and encrypt the plaintext, generating 2^56 results. The attacker will then generate every possible value for the second key, decrypt the ciphertext to generate another 2^56 results, and look for a match between the first and second batches. The meet-in-the-middle attack makes 2DES only twice as secure as DES because a maximum of 2^57 encryptions are required to break 2DES. 3DES uses three 56-bit keys to encrypt and, therefore, has two middles, either of which can be exploited by the meet-in-the-middle attack. This causes 3DES to have an effective security of 112 bits instead of 168 bits.

__[Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher)__ => To read and also check the following : running-key cipher, Vigenère cipher, book cipher, Caesar cipher.

A block transposition cipher operates by rearranging groups of characters. A cipher can be categorized based on the type of operation it uses to convert a plaintext mesasge into a ciphertext message. There are two basic operations that a cipher can perform on a plaintext message : substitution and transposition. A substitution cipher replaces the characters in a plaintext message with different characters, whereas a transposition cipher only rearranges the order of the characters in a plaintext message. A product cipher uses both transposition and substitution. A cipher can also be categorized on how it performs its function. A cipher that processes one character at a time is referred to as a stream cipher; Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) is a stream cipher. By contrast, a cipher that processes groups of characters is referred to as a block cipher; Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block ciphers. Block ciphers are generally stronger than stream ciphers but require more processing power.

In a [brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack), the attacker typically has access to only the ciphertext. The attacker will try every possible key until the ciphertext is decrypted. If the attacker is able to acquire multiple ciphertext messages, he can perform statistical analysis on the messages in order to spot patterns or trends, it can be exploited to make a brute-force attack more practical. __In a known plaintext attack, the attacker has access to both the plaintext and the ciphertext. The attacker will use the plaintext and ciphertext to attempt to extract the encryption key. [Linear cryptanalysis](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalyse_lin%C3%A9aire) is a known plaintext attack__.

> Using a rainbow table to compare known hashes to unknown hashes best describes a brute-force attack. A brute-force attack is a password cracking technique by which encrypted password hashes are compared to a list of known hashes and their decrypted counterparts. Unlike a dictionary attack or a hybrid attack, which use predefined lists of words, a brute-force attack attempts every possible combination of a password until a match is found. A rainbow table is a means of organizing known password hashes so that hash lookups are processed faster. The process of using a brute-force attack to decipher encrypted passwords is historically laborious. By using a rainbow table, a password cracking tool can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to crack a password.

__Encryption modes__ :
* Electronic Code Book (ECB mode)
* Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
* Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode
* Output Feedback (OFB) mode
* Counter (CTR) mode

ECB mode, which is the weakest encryption mode, can leave patterns in the ciphertext. When ECB mode is used, two identical plaintext fragments in a message will yield the same ciphertext, thereby causing patterns to emerge in the ciphertext. ECB mode is the only encryption mode that does not use an initialization vector (IV). An IV inserts random data into the first encrypted block. Chaining can be used along with IVs to seed subsequent blocks with previously encrypted blocks; this ensures that two identical plaintext messages are encrypted differently.

CBC mode employs an IV and chaining to destroy ciphertext patterns. Because CBC mode works in block mode, it encrypts messages one block at a time. Because chaining uses the results of the previous block to encrypt the next block, any encryption errors that occur will propagate to subsequent blocks, making it impossible to decrypt the message after the encryption error.

CFB mode is similar to CBC mode in that it employs an IV and a method to destroy ciphertext patterns. However, CFB mode works in stream mode, which encrypts one bit at a time. Stream mode chaining is called feedback, which uses the results of a predetermined number of previous bits to encrypt each subsequent bit. Like CBC mode, CFB mode is vulnerable to the propagation of encryption errors, destroying the integrity of the message beyond the initial encryption error.

OFB mode improves upon CFB mode by changing the way that feedback is generated. Unlike CFB mode, which uses the previous ciphertext for feedback, OFB uses the encryption subkey before it is compared to the plaintext by using the exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Because encryption errors occur when the subkey is compared to the plaintext, OFB mode does not propagate encryption errors. 

CTR mode uses a 64-bit counter for feedback. Because the counter does not depend on the results of previous bits or blocks of encryption, CTR mode can perform multiple encryptions in parallel, thereby increasing encryption and decryption speed. Like OFB mode, CTR mode does not propagate errors.

__[PCI DSS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norme_de_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_de_l%27industrie_des_cartes_de_paiement)__ :
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a security evaluation standard that was developed by The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). PCI DSS focuses on protecting customer data by using secure networks, managing vulnerabilities, implementing strong methods of access control, implementing network security tests and monitoring, and maintaining a security policy. In addition, the PCI DSS standards details the types of information about an account that can be stored, such as account numbers and card expiration dates; however, credit card or debit card security codes cannot be stored. The PCI DSS also requires that authentication data from a card's magnetic striple not be stored.

>Following PCI DSS, check the following links : [1](https://pciguru.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/p2pe-versus-e2ee/), [2](https://listings.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/pci_ptp_encryption.pdf).

__[Point-to-Point Encryption(P2PE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_encryption)__ : Point-to-point encryption (P2PE) is a standard established by the PCI Security Standards Council. Payment solutions that offer similar encryption but do not meet the P2PE standard are referred to as end-to-end encryption (E2EE) solutions. The objective of P2PE and E2EE is to provide a payment security solution that instantaneously converts confidential payment card (credit and debit card) data and information into indecipherable code at the time the card is swiped, in order to prevent hacking and fraud. It is designed to maximize the security of payment card transactions in an increasingly complex regulatory environment. Also read the following [link](https://pciguru.wordpress.com/2014/08/24/p2pe-versus-e2ee/).

>An external skimmer is least likely to be thwarted by implementing P2PE since it can capture the card data at the same time than the payment terminal.

__Security Domain__:
A group of subjects and objects with similar security requirements.

__Security Models__ : 
Security models of control are used to determine how security will be implemented, what subjects can access the system, and what objects they will have access to. Simply stated, they are a way to formalize security policy. Security models of control are typically implemented by enforcing integrity, confidentiality, or other controls

<br>

__List of Access Control Models__ (*Clickable text for each ACM below*)


>There are multiple types of access controls : <br> __Discretionary access controls__ => gives subjects full control of objects they have created or have been given access to, including sharing the objects with other subjects. A DAC uses permissions that are primarily determined by the owner of a data object, not organizational policy and a user's need to know. DACs assign permissions, such as read, write, and execute, to data objects. DAC permissions can also typically be modified by the system administrator. NT File System (NTFS) permissions and Extended File System 3 (EXT3) are examples of DACs. An authorized, nonadministrative user who creates a spreadsheet file on a Windows workstation can typically modify the permissions on that file so that only specific users or groups are allowed to access the file. In addition, the owner can enable those users to read the file but not write to the file, thereby protecting the integrity of the data within the file.<br> __Mandatory access controls__ => system enforced access control based on a subject's clearance and an object's label. A MAC uses permissions that are primarily determined by organizational policy and a user's need to know. MACs are controls that are enforced by a system. MAC permissions are assigned to data based on the clearance the user has to access the data. For example, a user who has a low-level clearance on a particular system might be able to list files in a directory but might not be able to read, write, or execute those files. A person with a mid-level clearance might be able to list the files and read the files in that same directory but might not be able to write or execute them. A person with a high-level clearance might be able to list, read, write, and execute files in the directory but might not be able to modify file permissions. Linux Intrusion Detection System (LIDS) is an example of an operating system (OS) that uses a MAC. <br> __Non discretionary access controls__ => Role based, subjects are grouped into roles and each role has access permissions based upon the role. It's also a *task based AC* since it can be based on a subject's tasks. A nondiscretionary access control uses permissions that are primarily determined by the administrator, not organizational policy and a user's need to know. Similar to a DAC, a nondiscretionary data access control enables the assignment of file permissions, such as read, write, and execute, to regulate access to data objects. However, only an administrator can set and modify the permissions when using a nondiscretionary access control. Role-based access controls and rule-based access controls are examples of nondiscretionary access controls. Role-based access controls, such as grouping user accounts into security groups in Microsoft Active Directory (AD), work by assigning permissions to the role a user assumes within the organization instead of directly to the user. Rule-based access controls work by consulting a list of criteria that must be met prior to enabling access to a data object for a particular user. An access control that prevents a user from accessing a file during a specific period of time is an example of a rule-based access control. <br> <br> __IMPORTANT__ : Explicit rights and permissions are rights and permissions that are assigned directly to a user account.


__[Bell-Lapadula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%E2%80%93LaPadula_model)__ : The Bell–LaPadula model (BLP) is a state machine model used for enforcing access control in government and military applications. It was developed by David Elliott Bell and Leonard J. LaPadula, subsequent to strong guidance from Roger R. Schell, to formalize the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) multilevel security (MLS) policy. The model is a formal state transition model of computer security policy that describes a set of access control rules which use security labels on objects and clearances for subjects. Security labels range from the most sensitive (e.g., "Top Secret"), down to the least sensitive (e.g., "Unclassified" or "Public").

The Bell–LaPadula model is an example of a model where there is no clear distinction between protection and security.

The Bell–LaPadula model focuses on data confidentiality and controlled access to classified information, in contrast to the Biba Integrity Model which describes rules for the protection of data integrity. In this formal model, the entities in an information system are divided into subjects and objects. The notion of a "secure state" is defined, and it is proven that each state transition preserves security by moving from secure state to secure state, thereby inductively proving that the system satisfies the security objectives of the model. The Bell–LaPadula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a computer system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions. A system state is defined to be "secure" if the only permitted access modes of subjects to objects are in accordance with a security policy. To determine whether a specific access mode is allowed, the clearance of a subject is compared to the classification of the object (more precisely, to the combination of classification and set of compartments, making up the security level) to determine if the subject is authorized for the specific access mode. The clearance/classification scheme is expressed in terms of a lattice. The model defines one discretionary access control (DAC) rule and two mandatory access control (MAC) rules with three security properties:

* The Simple Security Property states that a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level.
* The * (Star) Security Property states that a subject at a given security level may not write to any object at a lower security level.
* The Discretionary Security Property uses an access matrix to specify the discretionary access control.

<br>

__[Lattice-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_access_control)__ : 
In computer security, lattice-based access control (LBAC) is a complex access control model based on the interaction between any combination of objects (such as resources, computers, and applications) and subjects (such as individuals, groups or organizations).

In this type of label-based mandatory access control model, a lattice is used to define the levels of security that an object may have and that a subject may have access to. The subject is only allowed to access an object if the security level of the subject is greater than or equal to that of the object.

Mathematically, the security level access may also be expressed in terms of the lattice (a partial order set) where each object and subject have a greatest lower bound (meet) and least upper bound (join) of access rights. For example, if two subjects A and B need access to an object, the security level is defined as the meet of the levels of A and B. In another example, if two objects X and Y are combined, they form another object Z, which is assigned the security level formed by the join of the levels of X and Y.

LBAC is also known as a label-based access control (or rule-based access control) restriction as opposed to role-based access control (RBAC).

Lattice based access control models were first formally defined by Denning (1976); see also Sandhu (1993).

__[Biba model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biba_Model)__: is a formal state transition system of computer security policy describing a set of access control rules designed to ensure data integrity. Data and subjects are grouped into ordered levels of integrity. The model is designed so that subjects may not corrupt data in a level ranked higher than the subject, or be corrupted by data from a lower level than the subject. In general the model was developed to address integrity as the core principle, which is the direct inverse of the Bell–LaPadula model which focuses on confidentiality.

__[Clark-Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark%E2%80%93Wilson_model)__: The Clark–Wilson integrity model provides a foundation for specifying and analyzing an integrity policy for a computing system. The model is primarily concerned with formalizing the notion of information integrity. Information integrity is maintained by preventing corruption of data items in a system due to either error or malicious intent. An integrity policy describes how the data items in the system should be kept valid from one state of the system to the next and specifies the capabilities of various principals in the system. The model uses security labels to grant access to objects via transformation procedures and a restricted interface model. 

__[Chinese Wall model/Brewer-Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewer_and_Nash_model)__: The Brewer and Nash model was constructed to provide information security access controls that can change dynamically. This security model, also known as the Chinese wall model, was designed to provide controls that mitigate conflict of interest in commercial organizations and is built upon an information flow model. In the Brewer and Nash model, no information can flow between the subjects and objects in a way that would create a conflict of interest. This model is commonly used by consulting and accounting firms. For example, once a consultant accesses data belonging to Acme Ltd, a consulting client, they may no longer access data to any of Acme's competitors. In this model, the same consulting firm can have clients that are competing with Acme Ltd while advising Acme Ltd. This model uses the principle of data isolation within each conflict class of data to keep users out of potential conflict of interest situations. Because company relationships change all the time, dynamic and up-to-date updates to members and definitions for conflict classes are important. 

__[Matrix-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_matrix)__:
Because it does not define the granularity of protection mechanisms, the Access Control Matrix can be used as a model of the static access permissions in any type of access control system. It does not model the rules by which permissions can change in any particular system, and therefore only gives an incomplete description of the system's access control security policy.

An Access Control Matrix should be thought of only as an abstract model of permissions at a given point in time; a literal implementation of it as a two-dimensional array would have excessive memory requirements. Capability-based security and access control lists are categories of concrete access control mechanisms whose static permissions can be modeled using Access Control Matrices. Although these two mechanisms have sometimes been presented (for example in Butler Lampson's Protection paper) as simply row-based and column-based implementations of the Access Control Matrix, this view has been criticized as drawing a misleading equivalence between systems that does not take into account dynamic behaviour.

In this matrix example there exist two processes, two assets, a file, and a device. The first process is the owner of asset 1, has the ability to execute asset 2, read the file, and write some information to the device, while the second process is the owner of asset 2 and can read asset 1.

x | Asset 1 | Asset 2 | File | Device
---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---
__Role 1__ | Read, Write, Execute, Own | Execute | Read | Write
__Role 2__ | Read | Read, Write, Execute, Own |

<br>

__[Information-flow model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_(information_theory))__:
An information flow model is not a hierarchical model that defines layers of privilege. Instead, an information flow model describes how information should or should not be passed from subject to subject within a secure environment. For example, the Bell-LaPadula security model uses the information flow security model to define its "no read up" and "no write down" policies. The Biba security model uses the information flow security model to define its "no read down" and "no write up" policies. The Biba model focuses on integrity and is basically the opposite of the Bell-LaPadula model which focuses on confidentiality.

<br>

__[State machine model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)__:
A state machine model is not a hierarchical model that defines layers of privilege. Instead, a state machine model uses arithmetical calculations to determine the state of a system at a given time. Therefore, a state machine model allows or denies access to objects at different intervals of time. A door that is automatically locked at a certain time of the day and opened at another time is an example of the state machine model.

__Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture__ : The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture is a matrix-based methodology that enables the viewing of an architecture from six different perspectives. The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture is a formal methodology for organizing enterprise architectural information, such as design documents and specifications. The framework matrix contains six columns that consist of the communication questions Why, How, What, Who, Where, and When. The rows of the matrix consist of the following six "perspectives" of a solution: Contextual or planner's view, Conceptual or owner's view, Logical or designer's view, Physical or builder's view, As Built or subcontractor's view, and Functioning or actual system view. The cells at which a row and column meet contain plain language that describes the focus. For example, the cell at which the Contextual row meets the How column should contain a list of all of an organization's known processes.

>An overt channel is not a transmission or other communication that violates security policies. An overt channel is a transmission or other communication that is authorized and is performed in compliance with security policies. <br>Covert channels, whether storage-based or timing-based, are communications that are likely to violate security policies. For example, a covert storage channel might be a memory space or storage space that can be accessed by two processes that have different security levels. The process that has the lower security level could participate in an authorized exchange of sensitive information with the process that has the higher security level. It is also possible to use a covert timing channel to exchange information between processes. A covert timing channel exchanges information by exerting some amount of control over the rate that information is processed by a system. Covert timing channels are more difficult to detect than covert storage channels. However, it is more difficult to reliably collect information by using a covert timing channel.

__ISO 27001__ : is a security standard based on the second part of BS 7799 (ISO 17799/27002 are aswell). ISO 27001 (and 27002) includes the following 14 objectives :
* Security Policy
* Organization of Information Security
* Human Resources Security
* Asset Management
* Access Control
* Cryptography
* Physical and Environmental Security
* Operations Security
* Communications Security
* Informations Systems Acquisition, Development, Maintenance
* Supplier Relationships
* Information Security Incident Management
* Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity
* Compliance

*__ISO 27002 on the other hand is a security standard that recommends security controls based on industry best practices. It was renumbered from 17799 in 2005 to 27002, and is based on BS 7799. It shares the same 14 objectives listed above.__*

On that topic, COBIT is not based on BS 7799 and it defines the following four domains :
* Planning and organization
* Acquisition and implementation
* Delivery and Support
* Monitoring and Evaluation

## Domain 4 - Communication and Network Security

>__IMPORTANT__ : In the case of a TFTP server receiving a request from a client device on UDP port 69, the server will use a UDP port numbered above higher than 1023 that is generated by the client. The server listens to UDP port 69 but responds by using the client's dynamically generated port number. It always sends its response to a UDP port generated by the client. Ports from 0 to 1023 are __system ports__. Check [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).

__Multi-homed device__ : is a device that has more than one network connection.

> The IEEE 802.1X standard defines a method that uses EAP to establish port-based connections. IEEE 802.1X is designed to require authentication before a client is allowed access to a network. For example, a wireless network configured to use 802.1X requires that devices attempting to connect to the wireless access point (WAP) be authenticated before those devices can connect to the network. By default, ports on 802.1X-enabled devices are set to an unauthorized state; packets sent to ports from unauthenticated devices are dropped.

> HTTPS require the use of symmetric and asymmetric keys; S-HTTP does not require the use of asymmetric keys. Asymmetric-key encryption is often referred to as two-key or public-key cryptography. Symmetric key encryption is often referred to as single-key, shared-key, or private-key cryptography. Although S-HTTP supports asymmetric keys, it can be used with only symmetryc keys. Links : [1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2818), [2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2660).

>  S-HTTP was created in the 1990s as a security enhancement to the HTTP 1.1 protocol. In 1994, Netscape created HTTPS as an enhancement for its Navigator web browser. With Microsoft throwing its support behind HTTPS, S-HTTP never became widely used. S-HTTP does not encrypt the HTTP header; it encrypts only the HTTP data. As a result, a packet encrypted with S-HTTP is seen as an HTTP packet and can therefore be sent over TCP port 80. By contrast, HTTPS encrypts the entire message. Because HTTPS also encrypts the HTTP header, HTTPS packets look different from HTTP packets and must therefore use a different TCP port. HTTPS packets are sent over TCP port 443. S-HTTP encrypts packets at the Application layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, using DES or RC2 for encryption. By contrast, HTTPS encrypts packets at the Transport layer of the OSI model, using SSL/TLS for encryption.

*Server callback* : After a user dials in and authenticates to a remote access server that is configured to perform callback, the server will hang up and call the user back at a telephone number that has been preconfigured for the user. Although this method of remote access is relatively secure, it does not allow for a user to dial in from any location other than the one that has been configured by the system administrator. The remote access server will not prompt the user to enter the callback telephone number, nor will the remote access server give the user an access code and another telephone number to call.

Caller ID is another remote access technology. After a user dials in and authenticates to a server that is configured with Caller ID, the server will verify that the user is calling from the correct phone number and, if so, allow access to the user. Like callback, Caller ID requires that the administrator configure a user's remote access account with a telephone number from which the user must connect. However, Caller ID is less secure than callback because Caller ID numbers can be easily spoofed on most telephone systems.

<br>

__Content Distribution Network (CDN)__ : Availability, which is a component of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad, best describes the role of a CDN. A CDN is a large network of server resources connected to the Internet and distributed over a large geographical area. Data from a host is mirrored on the CDN so that it can be distributed to browsers in a more efficient fashion. For example, a web server in California might use a CDN that delivers content to a person in New York by way of a data center in New York instead of directly across the Internet from the web server in California. This delivery system reduces latency and provides an element of load balancing. Thus CDNs can offer some protection against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Typically, a CDN provides high availability (HA) by using edge caching.

Redundancy can be a by-product of a CDN, but it is not necessarily the primary role of a CDN. In other words, a CDN might have more than one copy of a given web server’s content distributed throughout a large network, creating redundancy. However, CDNs work by mirroring data from a primary source web server. If content is removed from the primary source web server, it is also removed from the CDN.

Integrity is not necessarily a role of a CDN. Integrity is the assurance that data from a given source has not been modified in transit to its destination. Typically, information integrity is produced by validating checksums on each end of a connection.

Although a CDN can offer encryption as a service, confidentiality is not the defining role of a CDN. Some CDN services offer end-to-end encryption as a premium service. However, this service also relies on the correct configuration of cryptographic keys on the source web host. Encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of information in transit between a source and a destination.

*Which of the following would you be most likely to connect to a promiscuous mode switch port ?*

Of the choices provided, you would be most likely to connect an IDS to a promiscuous mode switch port. An IDS is used to detect malicious or unauthorized traffic traversing a network. A promiscuous mode switch port is a port that monitors the traffic passing through the other switch ports. Promiscuous mode switch ports are sometimes called Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) ports or mirror ports. You can also provide promiscuous mode network access by using a hub or a Test Access Port (TAP).

*A company has asked you to upgrade their Internet connectivity. After some consideration, you decide to implement a T1 line. In which country is the company LEAST likely to be located ?*

Of the choices provided, the company is least likely to be located in the United Kingdom. T1 lines and T3 lines are used primarily in the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea; E1 lines and E3 lines are used in the rest of the world.

E1 is a digital networking technology that transfers data over 32 eight-bit timeslots. Each timeslot sends eight bits at a time, so a grouping of 32 timeslots is capable of sending 256 bits of data. E1 connections transmit 8,000 timeslot groupings per second, which raises the total throughput to 2,048,000 bps, or 2.048 Mbps. E1 connections use two pairs of shielded copper wire to transfer data: one pair to send data and one pair to receive data.

T1 transfers data over 24 eight-bit timeslots called DS0 channels. A DS1 signaling frame consists of 24 DS0 channels and one framing bit. Each of the 24 DS0 channels transfers eight bits of data at a time. The inclusion of the framing bit raises the total amount of data in a single DS1 frame to 193 bits. T1 lines transmit 8,000 DS1 frames per second, which brings the total throughput to 1,544,000 bps, or 1.544 Mbps. T1 connections typically transfer data across two pairs of shielded copper wires.

A T3 connection consists of 28 bundled T1 lines with a total throughput of 44.736 Mbps; this is equivalent to 672 eight-bit DS0 channels. T3 connections are usually too cost prohibitive for use except by Internet and telephone service providers.

An E3 connection consists of 24 bundled E1 lines with a total throughput of 34.368 Mbps; this is equivalent to 512 eight-bit timeslots. E3 connections are usually too cost prohibitive for use except by Internet and telephone service providers.

__[Dynamic Routing Protocols](https://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/comparing-dynamic-routing-protocols)__:

>Basically, interior protocols are meant to dynamically route data across a network that you fully control and maintain. Exterior routing protocols are used to exchange routes between distinctly separate networks that you have no administrative control over.

* __Routing Information Protocol (RIP)__ is best described as a distance-vector routing protocol, which measures the best route to a destination network by hop count. Routing protocols are used by Layer 3 devices to determine the best path to a destination network. RIP is an interior gateway protocol (IGP), which is a routing protocol that is typically used to route traffic between devices that reside within the same autonomous system (AS).
* __Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)__ is best described as a link-state routing protocol, which gathers routing information from each neighboring link to calculate the best path to a destination network. Like RIP, OSPF is an IGP.
* __Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)__ is best described as a hybrid routing protocol, which means that it contains elements of both link-state routing protocols and distance-vector routing protocols. Like RIP and OSPF, EIGRP is an IGP.
* __Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)__ is best described as a path-vector routing protocol, which calculates the best route based on the entire path to the destination. Unlike RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, BGP is an exterior gateway protocol (EGP). An EGP is a routing protocol that is typically used to route between ASes.

>You should install a router to create multiple broadcast domains on your company's network. Broadcast packets from one broadcast domain are not forwarded to other broadcast domains. In a router, each routed network interface creates a separate broadcast domain. You can also create a virtual local area network (VLAN) on a Layer 3 switch to create a separate broadcast domain. Each VLAN creates a separate broadcast domain.


<br>

__Example of DoS attacks__ :

* __Teardrop attack__ : attack in which an attacker sends several large overlapping IP fragments. The victim system will attempt to reassemble these packets, sometimes causing the system to crash. The teardrop attack is called a DoS attack, because it denies service to the victim.
* __Smurf attack__ : attack in which an attacker pings a broadcast address by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets with a forged source address. Every device that receives the ICMP ping will send an echo reply to the forged source address, which can overwhelm the device at that source address. Therefore, the smurf attack is also a DoS attack.
* __Fraggle attack__ : attack in which an attacker sends UDP echo and chargen packets with a forged source address. Every device that receives one of these UDP broadcast will send a response to the spoofed source address, which can overwhelm the device at that source address. Therefore, the fraggle attack is also a DoS attack.
* __SYN flood attack__ : A SYN flood attack occurs at the Transport layer of the OSI model; SYN flood uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is a connection-oriented Transport layer protocol. Connection-oriented protocols provide for reliable delivery of data. A SYN flood attack is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker will begin multiple TCP handshakes by sending several SYN packets. The victim will add the connection requests to a connection table and respond with SYN/ACK packets. Because the attacker never completes the TCP handshake process by sending ACK packets to acknowledge the SYN/ACKs, the victim's connection table will fill and eventually cause the victim's system to refuse connections, thereby causing a DoS condition.

> A spoofing attack is the most likely type of attack to occur at the same time as a DoS attack against a trusted system on your company's network. A spoofing attack involves the manipulation of data packets so that the data appears to be coming from a known and trusted source. A DoS attack involves flooding a network device with traffic so that resources on the device become overwhelmed. The victim device is then no longer able to process new traffic. Therefore, a malicious user could use a DoS attack to prevent a trusted device from participating on the network and then spoof the address of that trusted device. The spoofing attack would be more difficult to discover because the DoS attack would prevent the genuine trusted host from conflicting the malicious host.

__[Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking))__ : Facts about encapsulation :
* Segments are encapsulated in packets.
* Packets are encapsulated in frames
* Frames are converted to bits at the Physical layer

>The process of encapsulation takes information from a higher layer and adds a header to it. For example, at the Transport layer of the OSI model, a header is added to application data in order to create a protocol data unit (PDU) called a segment. At the Network layer, a header is added to the segment; this new PDU is called a packet. At the Data Link Layer, a header is added to the packet; this PDU is called a frame. At the Physical layer, frames are converted to bits and sent over the network.

__[Dual stack](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_d%27IPv4_vers_IPv6)__ : enable a host to communicate with both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. Dual stack service are configured with an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address. The host can therefore communicate with both without requiring any protocol translation.

__[IPv6 Addressing](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipv6_basic/configuration/xe-3s/ip6b-xe-3s-book/ip6-add-basic-conn-xe.html)__ : In relation to that, check [EUI-64 (1)](https://www.it-connect.fr/ipv6-quest-ce-que-leui-64-13/) and [EUI-64 (2)](https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-knowledge-base/understanding-ipv6-eui-64-bit-address/ta-p/3116953).

__List of important things to check__:
* __[Network Admission Control(NAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Admission_Control)__

* __[Firewall](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pare-feu_(informatique))__ : In a firewall's ACL, the rules are executed in order from top to bottom. Can also check [this link](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy).

* __[CCMP](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Mode/CBC-Mac_protocol)__ : Integrity method used by WPA2. Created to correct vulnerabilities in TKIP, it fully implements the IEEE 802.11i standard. It creates a message integrity code (MIC) that can be used to validate whether the message source or the payload data was altered in transit. Also check [WPA/WPA2](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access) and [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/wifi-security-explained/).

* __[DNSSEC](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows-server/networking/dns/dnssec-overview)__ : is a set of security extensions that are intended to make DNS more secure. The overall DNS namespace is organized into units of administration known as zones. The use of DNSSEC involves two aspects: (1) adding special records to a zone that include digital signatures for the other records in the zone and (2) using those signatures to verify response queries of the zone. DNSSEC is likely to mitigate Pharming attacks which is cache poisoning of a DNS server with false information.

* __[Software Defined Networking (SDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking)__ : Note, the control plane is centralized on the SDN network. The software controller assumes the control plane functionality for all network devices. Because the software controller manages the control plane for the entire network, an SDN is more vulnerable to footprinting than a traditional network implementation. It most commonly uses XACML (OASIS standard).

* __[TFTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1350)__

>You should always use a /30 subnet mask for point-to-point links since it only provides two usable IP addresses. In the case of the following IP address 192.168.0.128/30, .128 is the network address, .131 is the broadcast and .129/.130 can be given to each point of the link. More information [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html).

__[Bluetooth](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)__ :
Bluetooth v2.1 uses a weak encryption cipher, E0. Although E0 uses a 128-bit key, attack methods have been developed that have proven the E0 cipher to be only as strong as a 38-bit key, and adding more bits to the key doesn't improve security. Bluetooth v2.1 doesn't send data as clear text. Bluetooth versions 4.1 and later use a strong encryption cipher, Advanced Encryption Standard-Counter with CBC-MAC/CCMP (AES-CCM).

__[Open Shortest Path First - OSPF](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First)__ : is a link routing state protocol, learns the entire network topology for the area.

__[Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol)__ : Can be used to authenticate Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) sessions, will periodically reauthenticate users at random times during a session. PPP is a protocol that can be used to establish a connection betwenn two network devices. CHAP requires that clients connecting to the network have a shared key so that challenges and responses can be exchanged successfully. Thus authentication is maintained when challenges that require a response are sent at random times during the session; an invalid challenge or response will terminate the connection.

## Domain 5 - Identity and Access Management (IAM)

__Authentication methods__ :
* __Type 1__ : something you know ; challenge/response to which the user must respond with knowledgeable answer such as a password/pin. Easiest/weakest form of auth.
* __Type 2__ : something you have ; requires that the user possesses something such as a token which proves they are an authenticated user.
* __Type 3__ : something you are ; biometrics.

__Passwords__ :
* __Static passwords__ : reusable passwords that may or may not expire. Work best when combined with another authentication type such as a smart card or biometrics.
* __Passphrases__ : long static passwords comprised of words in a phrase or sentence.
* __One-time passwords__ : Used for single auth. Very secure but difficult to manage.
* __Dynamic passwords__ : Change at regular intervals. The user combines his static PIN with the dynamic password to create a password that changes everytime it is used.

>[DoD password guidelines](https://www.stigviewer.com/controls/8500/IAIA-1)


__Tokens__ :
* __Synchronous dynamic token__ : uses time or counters to synchronize a displayed token code with the code expected by the authentication server.
    * __Time based tokens__ : display dynamic codes that change frequently.
    * __Counter-based tokens__ : Authentication Server expects code 1, user's token displays same code 1. Once used, token displays the second code, auth server expects code 2 (to clarify ?).
* __Asynchronous dynamic token__ : Not synchronized with authentication server. Most common variety is challenge-response token => produces challenge or input for token device. User enters info + PIN, device produces output which is sent to the system.

__Biometrics__ : Three metrics of accuracy for biometric systems
* __False Reject Rate (FRR)__ => Type 1 error.
* __False Accept Rate (FAR)__ => Type 2 error (worse than type 1 of course)
* __Crossover Error Rate (CER)__ => Also known as Equal Error Rate (EER), overall accuracy.

>Minutiae is another term for loops, whorls, ridges, and bifurcations that are found in fingerprints. Fingerprint scanners match mathematical calculations derived from fingerprint minutiae to a database of mathematical calculations derived from known fingerprint minutiae. Although fingerprints are unique to every individual, cuts, scars, or sores on fingers can interfere with the accuracy of fingerprint analysis and cause false rejects. In addition, fingerprint analysis requires the authenticating user to touch the fingerprint scanner, which could spread illness. Therefore, a fingerprint analysis can be invasive. [Link](https://www.biometric-solutions.com/fingerprint-recognition.html).

<br>

__Smartcard attacks__ : A smartcard is under attack if an attacker is attempting to obtain information by using a side-channel attack that is intended to create a fault. Side-channel attacks are passive attacks that are intended to glean information from a device, such as a smartcard, by observing how the device operates under given conditions. There are several types of side-channel attacks, including all of the following :
* __Fault analysis attacks__, which work by adjusting the smartcard's operating environment, such as denying power, in order to create an error
* __Power differential attacks__, which are a type of power-monitoring attack and work by directly connecting to pins and attempting to translate power fluctuations
* __Timing attacks__, which work by analyzing the amount of time required to process cryptographic operations
* __Emanation attacks__, which work by analyzing the electromagnetic fields produced by device operations.

<br>

__Shared accounts__ : See the PDF file in CISSP Files, Use of Shared Accounts.

__Decentralized Access Control Administration__ : Decentralized access control administration requires more administrative overhead than centralized access control administration. Decentralized access control administration is a form of identity and access management (IAM) that distributes the responsibility for authentication and authorization across systems. For example, a router that authenticates users from a locally stored database might be part of a decentralized access control administration system that includes several other routers that use locally stored databases. In such a case, the router is a security domain, or sphere of trust, that requires subjects to be individually added to its local database in order to provide access. It requires more administrative overhead.

<br>

__[ISAKMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Security_Association_and_Key_Management_Protocol)__ : In the case of a VPN between two sites, ISAKMP would create one SA (Security Association) for each link (inbound/outbound), therefore creating 4 SAs in this case (2 for inbound/outbound for each site to the VPN). To identify each unidirectional SA, a 32-bit number called a Security Parameter Index (SPI) is generated by the sending device.

__[Mutual Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)__ : It can prevent a client from divulging information to a rogue server. A rogue server is an unauthorized server posing as a valid server. A mutual authentication model requires that both the sender and the receiver verify their identities, typically through the use of digital certificates. Mutual authentication can prevent identity spoofing because both parties are required to authenticate. [Microsoft link for more information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-authsod/1691cf8a-2049-49f5-8940-3cf5640496fe).

__[SSO](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentification_unique)__ : will not prevent a client from divulging information to a rogue server. It is an authentication method that can be implemented to limit the number of times users must provide credentials to access resources on a network. On networks where SSO has been implemented, a user is prompted for credentials only when the user starts, restarts or unlocks his computer.

__[MFA](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_authentification)__ : will not prevent a user from divulging information to a rogue server. MFA requires that a user provide more than one form of identification, such as a fingerprint, username and password, or smartcard.

__Nonrepudiation__ : will not prevent a client from divulging information to a rogue server. It is the ability to prove the authenticity of communication between two parties. Digital signatures are an example.

>Following the authentication methods mentioned just above, check the [following link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc512611(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) which is about rogue machine threats and 802.1x.

__[Kerberos](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocole))__ => To read. An example of a kerberos vulnerability is Single point of failure. It can be mitigated by deploying more than one KDC. Vulnerable to replay attacks.

__[Geofencing](https://www.smappen.fr/blog/geofencing/)__ : Technology that can automatically trigger actions depending on the physical location of a device. For example, geofencing can send an alert to administrators if a specific device is transported beyond a predefined set of boundaries.

__[Geotagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging)__ : Process of identifying the physical location of a given device by examining the characteristics of the content that is generated by using the device. Geolocation information on social media posts, photographs, videos, phone calls and text messages are all forms of geotagging.

__[Geotargeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotargeting)__ : Marketing tactic that is similar to geofencing but includes a user's demographic data when decisions are made about what advertising to display. Not typically used for security applications.

__[Geolocating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopositioning)__ : Also known as geopositioning, is the process of determining the location of a given device. It works by using a combination of GPS technology and cellular network triangulation to pinpoint the real-time longitude and latitude of the device.

__[X.400]()__ : X.400 is a set of directory technology guidelines that has been mostly replaced by SMTP. Directory technologies are centralized databases of user information that can be used to provide identification, authentication and authorization services on a network. X.400 was created by the International Telecommunications Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) to standardize the transfer and storage of email on computer networks. X.400 has some characteristics in common with other directory technologies, such as X.500 and LDAP. One common characteristic between the technologies is the use of Organizational Units (OUs), which are designed to allow directory administrators to classify directory information.

---

__XACML__ : OASIS standard that is the most used by SDN systems. XACML is an Extensible Markup Laguage (XML) based open standard developed by OASIS that is typically used to define access control policies. These policies can either be attribute based or role based.

__SAML__ : is an OASIS standard that is most commonly used by web applications to create a single-sign-on (SSO) experience. SAML is an XML based open standard. SAML can be used to exchange authentication and authorization information. Similar to OpenID and Windows Live ID, a SAML-based system enables a user to gain access to multiple independent systems on the internet after having authenticated to only one of those systems.

> The identity provider (IdP) is a SAML entity that verifies authentication and authorization information. SAML is an open standard that is used to provide single sign-on (SSO) capabilities by exchanging authorization credentials within a federation. There are three SAML entities: the IdP, the service provider (SP), and the subject, which is also called the principal or user agent. The subject is the entity that is attempting to authenticate. The SP is the entity that is being asked by the subject to provide a service or resource. The IdP is the entity that vouches for the subject.

__SPML__ : is an XML based open standard developed by OASIS. SPML is used for federated identity SSO. Unlike SAML, SPML is also based on Directory Services Markup Language (DSML). DSML is an XML based technology that can be used to present Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) information in XML format.

>OAuth2.0 is not an OASIS standard. Instead, OAuth2.0 is an open standard defined in Request For Comments (RFC) 6749. OAuth2.0 is an authorization framework that provides a third-party application with delegated access to resources without providing the owner's credentials to the application. There are four roles in OAuth : the resource owner, the client, the resource server, and the authorization server. The resource owner is typically an end user. The client is a third-party application that the resource owner wants to use. The resource server hosts protected resources, and the authorization server issues access tokens after successfully authenticating the resource owner; the resource owner and authorization server are often the same entity but can be separate.

In system high mode, users must have a security clearance and access approval that permits access to all information processed by the system. However, they must have a valid need to know only for the information they will access on the system; they are not required to have a valid need to know for all of the information processed by the system. There are four security modes for systems that process classified information :
* Dedicated mode
* System high mode
* Compartmented mode
* Multilevel mode

In dedicated mode, users must have a security clearance, access approval, and a valid need to know for all information processed by the system. Therefore, all of the users on the system can access all of the data on the system. Requirements are enforced by the administrative personnel who physically limit access to the system, not by the hardware or software on the system.

In compartmented mode, users must have a security clearance for all information processed by the system. However, they must have access approval and a valid need to know only for the information they will access on the system, not for all of the information processed by the system.

In multilevel mode, users must have a security clearance, access approval, and a valid need to know that permits only the information they will access on the system. Users do not need a security clearance, access approval, and need to know for all of the information processed by the system. Requirements are enforced primarily by the hardware or software on the system, not by limiting physical access to the system.

## Domain 6 - Security Assessment and Testing

__Pentesting methodology__ :
* Planning
* Reconnaissance
* Scanning (also enumeration)
* Vulnerability assessment
* Exploitation
* Reporting

*Look for gray-box testing (or partial-knowledge testing), double-blind testing (blackbox), blind testing and whitebox testing (lights-on approach, testing with knowledge)*

<br>

The entire body of data that is gathered by event logging is known as an audit trail. Audit trails enable a security professional to construct a timeline of events and actions that occurred on a system. A record that is created from an audit trail can then be used as evidence to prove that a specific individual or entity is responsible for malicious activity on a system. Audit trails can also be used to detect malicious activity on a system or network and to determine the extent of the damage caused by an attack.

An organization should request a SOC 1 Type 1 report if it requires an assessment of the financial reporting controls implemented within the organization at a specific point in time. Third-party audits typically adhere to the standards defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements document 18 (SSAE 18) or by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) International Standard for Attestation Engagements (ISAE) 3402, which is titled Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization. These standards describe three basic types of engagement for reporting on controls at a service organization :

* SOC 1 engagements – assess organization controls related to financial reporting 
* SOC 2 engagements – assess organization controls related to security, availability, integrity, and confidentiality and produce results intended only for internal distribution
* SOC 3 engagements – assess organization controls related to security, availability, integrity, and confidentiality and produce results intended for general distribution

SOC 2 and SOC 3 engagements differ primarily in the confidentiality of their results. SOC 2 engagements produce results that contain confidential information that is typically intended for distribution within the organization. However, if the results of a SOC 2 engagement are shared with an external entity, a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) is required involved to preserve the confidential information. By contrast, the results of a SOC 3 engagement are intended for general distribution and can be disclosed to the public without the risk of leaking confidential information.

In addition to the three basic types of engagement, there are also two basic types of report that can be produced by each engagement. Type 1 reports address the design and implementation of the controls in place at an organization at a specific point in time. These reports do not test the controls or assess their functional effectiveness. Instead, Type 1 reports provide only theoretical assessments of the controls and their suitability. By contrast, Type 2 reports assess organizational controls over a period of time and evaluate their operation and effectiveness. See the following [link](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/landing/system-and-organization-controls-soc-suite-of-services).

NIST recommends that an administrator implement vulnerability scanners from multiple vendors to maximize the number of vulnerabilities detected. A vulnerability scanner can gather information about a system's security state, patch levels, and vulnerability to known exploits. Most vulnerability scanners rely on an online database to ensure that the latest exploit information is available for the vulnerability testing. Although it is impossible for one database to include every known exploit, many of the products available aggregate the exploit information from a number of sources into their databases. For this reason, NIST recommends implementing a secondary vulnerability scanner from a separate vendor. Using exploit databases from two separate vendors should increase the number of detectable vulnerabilities to within an acceptable range. Most vulnerability scanners provide at least two modes of scanning :
* __[Noncredentialed](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus-agent/Content/TraditionalScansUncredentialed.htm)__ : A traditional active non-credentialed scan, also known as an unauthenticated scan, is a common method for assessing the security of systems without system privileges. Non-credentialed scans enumerate a host's exposed ports, protocols, and services and identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could allow an attacker to compromise your network. It can be disruptive ; negative effects on the network/device/application being tested. It misses client-side vulnerabilities such as detailed patch information.
* __[Credentialed](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus-agent/Content/TraditionalScanCredentialed.htm)__ : use valid credentials to access the system and services and are less disruptive than noncredentialed scans. In addition, credentialed scans can access significantly more of a target system and can therefore provide better intelligence, such as a list of all installed applications and their revision.

## Domain 7 - Security Operations

__Rules of evidence (See 652.pdf)__ :
* __Be authentic__
* __Be accurate__
* __Be complete__
* __Be convincing__
* __Be admissible__

__Network forensics__ : Study of data in motion with a special focus on gathering evidence. Closely related to network intrusion detection. The former focuses on legalities while the latter focuses on operations.


>__FYI :__ in the case of collecting evidence from a hard drive during a forensics investigation, __we are less likely to do a full backup of the drive__. Hard drive space that contains remnants of of deleted data would not be copied. In addition to copying only allocated space, a full backup clears the archive bit from each file that it has backed up. Therefore, a full backup can modify the contents of the original drive. During a forensics investigation, it is important to prevent modification to potential evidence.


> Using an image of the disk to collect the data is most likely to prevent the corruption of evidence in this scenario. A disk image is an exact copy of an entire hard drive, including its currently unallocated space. This means that data that was deleted from the original hard drive in this scenario could potentially be recovered as evidence by performing collection on the image. Performing data collection on the image preserves the data on the original hard disk in its original form, thereby preventing corruption or modification of the evidence.


__International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)__ : has established several certifications that are specifically designed for digital forensics investigators. The following three certification programs have been established by IACIS :
* Certified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE)
* Certified Advanced Windows Forensic Examiner (CAWFE)
* IACIS Certified Mobile Device Examiner (ICMDE)

Although several questions on ISC² certification exams relate to digital forensics, these exams are not specifically designed for digital forensics investigatiors.

The IEEE has not established certifications for digital forensics investigators. IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization for the advancement of technology with more than 420,000 members. Many standards have been deployed and maintained by IEEE, including the IEEE 802 standard, which deals with LAN networks and MAN networks.

NIST has not established certifications for digital forensics investigators. However, NIST has developed the Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project, which tests and certifies digital forensic tools. NIST is also developing Computer Forensics Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) for digital evidence. NIST is a nonregulatory agency of the US Department of Commerce that promotes scientific innovation and standardization.

Because of the variability of the change management process, specifically named phases have not been offered in this section. However, the general flow of the change management process includes :
* Identifying a change
* Proposing a change
* Assessing the risk associated with the change
* Testing the change

__Developing a BCP/DRP__

It is vital for an organization's ability to respond and recover from an interruption in normal business functions or catastrophic event. In order to ensure that all planning has been considered, the BCP/DRP has a specific set of requirements to review and implement. Below are listed these high-level steps, according to NIST SP800-34, to achieving a sound, logical BCP/DRP. NIST SP800-34 is the National Institute of Standards and Technologies Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems.

* __Project initiation__ : involves seven distinct milestones :
    * *Develop the contingency planning policy statement* : A formal department or agency policy 
    provides the authority and guidance necessary to develop an effective contingency plan.
    * *Conduct the BIA* : The BIA helps identify and prioritize critical IT systems and components. A 
    template for developing the BIA is also provided to assist the user.
    * *Identify preventive controls* : Measures taken to reduce the effects of system disruptions can 
    increase system availability and reduce contingency life-cycle costs.
    * *Develop recovery strategies* : Thorough recovery strategies ensure that the system may be 
    recovered quickly and effectively following a disruption.
    * *Develop an IT contingency plan* : The contingency plan should contain detailed guidance and 
    procedures for restoring a damaged system.
    * *Plan testing, training, and exercises* : Testing the plan identifies planning gaps, whereas training 
    prepares recovery personnel for plan activation; both activities improve plan effectiveness and 
    overall agency preparedness.
    * *Plan maintenance* : The plan should be a living document that is updated regularly to remain 
    current with system enhancements.
* __Scope of the project__
* __Business Impact Analysis (BIA)__
* __Identify Preventive Controls__
* __Recovery Strategy__
* __Plan Design and Development__
* __Implementation, Training and Testing__
* __BCP/DRP maintenance__

__There are five primary methods of testing a DRP__ :
* A __read-through test__ involves the distribution of DRP documents to other members of the DR team. Each member of the team reviews the DRP to ensure familiarity with the plan, to identify obsolete or erroneous material, and to identify DRP roles that are missing personnel assignments.
* A __structured walk-through test__ is also known as a table-top exercise, is a step beyond the read-through test in that the DR team gather around a table to role-play the DRP in person given a disaster scenario known only to the gathering's moderator. Following the structured walk-through test, team members review the DRP to determine the appropriate actions to take given the scenario.
* A __simulation test__ is a step beyond the structured walk-through test in that members of the DR team are asked to develop a response to a given disaster. The input from the DR team is then considered for testing against simulated disaster to determine viability.
* A __parallel test__ is a step beyond a simulation test in that employees are relocated to the DRP's recovery location. At the location, employees are expected to activate the recovery site just as they might when faced with a genuine disaster. However, operations at the primary site are never shut down.
* A __full interruption test__ is a step beyond the parallel test in that employees are relocated to the DRP's recovery location and a full shutdown of operations occurs at the primary location. Of all the DRP testing methods, a full-interruption test is the least likely to occur because it results in significant business interruption that might be deemed unnecessary by management.

__Conduct BIA__

*(Read the CISSP 11th Hour from pages 166 to 179)*

BIA is the formal method for determining how a disruption to the IT system(s) of an 
organization will impact the organization's requirements, processes, and interdependencies with respect to the business mission. It is an analysis to identify and prioritize critical IT systems and components. It enables the BCP/DRP project manager to fully characterize the IT contingency requirements and priorities.

The objective is to correlate the IT system components with the critical service it supports. It also aims to quantify the consequence of a disruption to the system component and how that will affect the organization. The primary goal of the BIA is to determine the Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) for a specific IT asset. This will directly impact what disaster recovery solution is chosen.

__Steps to establish a BIA__ :

* __Identify Critical Assets__ : The critical asset list is a list of those IT assets that are deemed business-essential by the organization. These systems' DRP/BCP must have the best available recovery capabilities assigned to them.
* __Conduct BRP/DRP focused risk assessment__ : The BCP/DRP-focused risk assessment determines what risks are inherent to which IT assets. A vulnerability analysis is also conducted for each IT system and major application. This is done because most traditional BCP/DRP evaluations focus on physical security threats, both natural and human.
* __Determine Maximum Tolerable Downtime__ : The primary goal of the BIA is to determine the MTD, which describes the total time a system can be inoperable before an organization is severely impacted. MTD is comprised of two metrics: the Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and the Work Recovery Time (WRT) (see later).
* __Failure and recovery metrics__ : A  number of metrics are used to quantify how frequently systems fail, how long a system may exist in a failed state, and the maximum time to recover from failure. These metrics include the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), RTO, WRT, Mean Time 
Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and Minimum Operating Requirements (MOR).
    * *Recovery Point Objective* : The RPO is the amount of data loss or system inaccessibility (measured in time) that an organization can withstand. If you perform weekly backups, someone made a decision that your company could tolerate the loss of a week's worth of data. If backups are performed on Saturday evenings and a system fails on Saturday afternoon, you have lost the entire week's worth of data. This is the RPO. In this case, the RPO is 1 week. The RPO represents the maximum acceptable amount of data/work loss for a given process because of a disaster or disruptive event
    * *Recovery Time Objective and Work Recovery Time* : The RTO describes the maximum time allowed to recover business or IT systems. RTO is also called the systems recovery time. This is one part of MTD; once the system is physically running, it must be configured.
    * *Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)* : MTBF quantifies how long a new or repaired system will run before failing. It is typically generated by a component vendor and is largely applicable to hardware as opposed to applications and software.
    * *Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)* : The MTTR describes how long it will take to recover a specific failed system. It is the best estimate for reconstituting the IT system so that business continuity may occur.
    * *Minimum Operating Requirements (MOR)* : MOR describe the minimum environmental and connectivity requirements in order to operate computer equipment. It is important to determine and document what the MOR is for each IT-critical asset because in the event of a disruptive event or disaster, proper analysis can be conducted quickly to determine if the IT assets will be able to function in the emergency environment.

*What best describes the purpose of SIEM ?*

A security information and event management (SIEM) device monitors a group of servers, providing real-time analysis of security events. SIEM, which is sometimes called security event management (SEM) or security information management (SIM), can be performed by software appliances, by hardware appliances, and by managed services. SIEM products can be used to monitor alerts sent by servers or security appliances, such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs). These alerts are analyzed by the SIEM system for correlations or trends, and if an abnormality or threat is detected, the SIEM system can notify an administrator. For example, you can configure servers to send an alert to an SIEM system if critical files are changed.

Data loss prevention (DLP) is software that monitors data to determine whether confidential files are being transmitted without user or administrator consent. DLP might also log access to sensitive files to determine which users accessed data and when. DLP solutions can be network-focused. Network-focused DLP solutions inspect data in motion, such as data that is being transmitted across a network from a workstation to another device.

A cloud access security broker (CASB) is used to monitor and protect traffic between cloud service providers and hosts on the local network. CASB solutions can either be installed on premises or operate from a cloud provider. Traffic between cloud software users on the local network and cloud software passes through CASB software before arriving at the destination. The traffic is scanned and analyzed by the CASB solution in order to monitor user activity, detect security risks, and alert administrators to potential problems. CASB solutions are also capable of preventing the installation of malware. 

A wireless IPS (WIPS) mitigates unauthorized access attacks by analyzing traffic on a wireless network. A WIPS monitors wireless traffic in an effort to detect unauthorized network access attempts. This process involves a system of sensors that scan the wireless spectrum and a server that performs an analysis of the packets that are captured by the sensors. A third component, the console, enables administrators to access the server and configure the WIPS or gather reporting from it. A WIPS can be installed on a local network and isolated from the Internet, or it can be hosted by a provider.

__Difference between threat agent/threat vector__

A threat agent is the individual or group of individuals who are responsible for a threat that exploits a given vulnerability. Therefore, a threat agent can be a malicious individual, a group of malicious individuals, or a careless individual who unintentionally causes the threat.

A threat vector is a potential medium that an attacker can use to exploit a vulnerability. Threat vectors are typically exploited by threat agents. Attackers can use an email attachment to deliver a virus, a trojan horse or other malicious content. Open ports on a networked host, phone lines, poorly secured web applications and similar media are also examples of threat vectors.

An email attachment arriving in someone's mailbox is an example of a threat vector.

A lone attacker launching a DoS attack is an example of a threat agent because the attacker is responsible for the attack.

A group of attackers launching a DoS attack is an example of a threat agent because the attackers are responsible for the attack.

A careless employee downloading a malware is an example of a threat agent because the employee is responsible for creating the threat by downloading the malware.

__Leaking of information to a competitor__

For example, you are investigating the leaking of your company's confidential information to a competitor. You suspect that a user's company smartphone might contain images, text messages, and confidential emails that have been sent to another individual outside of your company. __You should CONFISCATE the phone, CONFISCATION is the best method of ensuring that evidence of malicious activity is preserved when you are dealing with an end-user device__. Many organizations require a new employee to sign a document that indicates an understanding that company equipment might be conficated for investigative purposes.

---
>Security professionnals must weight several factors, including function, when deciding on an appropriate access control. For example, a company that protects sensitive data or valuables and does not need to present a friendly face to the public might have stricter visible access controls than a fast food restraurant has.

__Security domain__: A group of subjects and objects with similar security requirements.

__[Least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)__: The principle means giving any users account or processes only those privileges which are essentially vital to perform its intended functions. For example, a user account for the sole purpose of creating backups does not need to install software: hence, it has rights only to run backup and backup-related applications. Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked. The principle applies also to a personal computer user who usually does work in a normal user account, and opens a privileged, password protected account only when the situation absolutely demands it. When applied to users, the terms least user access or least-privileged user account (LUA) are also used, referring to the concept, that all user accounts should run with as few privileges as possible, and also launch applications with as few privileges as possible. 

__[Compartmentalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(information_security))__: in information security, whether public or private, is the limiting of access to information to persons or other entities on a need-to-know basis to perform certain tasks. It originated in the handling of classified information in military and intelligence applications. It dates back to antiquity, and was successfully used to keep the secret of Greek fire. The basis for compartmentalization is the idea that, if fewer people know the details of a mission or task, the risk or likelihood that such information will be compromised or fall into the hands of the opposition is decreased. Hence, varying levels of clearance within organizations exist. Yet, even if someone has the highest clearance, certain "compartmentalized" information, identified by codewords referring to particular types of secret information, may still be restricted to certain operators, even with a lower overall security clearance. Information marked this way is said to be codeword–classified. One famous example of this was the Ultra secret, where documents were marked "Top Secret Ultra": "Top Secret" marked its security level, and the "Ultra" keyword further restricted its readership to only those cleared to read "Ultra" documents. In other words, __it is an access control principle that ensures that information does not flow between groups of users__. It isolates groups of users from other groups of users based on the information or access required by the groups. For example, an administrator might choose to isolate access to accounting information to users in the accounting department. The accounting department might also have its own server and network so that the separation between the accounting department and other departments is more than logical.

__[Need To Know](https://security.berkeley.edu/need-know-access-control-guideline)__: 
To protect covered data from falling into the wrong hands, it’s important that resource proprietors and resource custodians understand which users have access and why these users need access to covered systems and data.
The decision process for users to gain access to covered systems and data must be based on the need-to-know principle, which is that access to covered data must be necessary for the conduct of the users’ job functions.
Such decision process must be applied to a user’s covered account at all stages of the account’s life cycle, including initial request/provisioning, and any time the account holder’s employment/enrollment status is updated thereafter (e.g. account holder changes position, moves to different departments/groups, leaves campus, etc).
Processes that help to enforce access control based on need-to-know principle include:

* Employ a process for resource proprietor to grant access to covered systems based on legitimate business need.  All application access requests should be reviewed by the resource proprietor or his/her designated delegate.  Any decisions to approve or reject access requests by the resource proprietor or delegate should be documented.
* Employ a process for resource proprietor or his/her delegate to review access to systems when a user changes job function and update access to reflect user’s new job function.  
* Develop a process to immediately revoke access to accounts after a user leaves the campus unless documented business requirements permit an extended grace period in which departed users are allow access to covered systems.
* Implement proper Account Management and Monitoring controls.

>FYI : A need to know access control principle is most likely to restrict a CIO from accessing financial reports. Need to know is an access control principle that requires that a user have no access to information that is not required by the user, even if that user has a rank, clearance level, authorization for greater access. For example, a company's accounting department might choose to restrict the company's CIO from accessing financial reports, even though the CIO is a high ranking officer.

__[Account Monitoring and Management](https://security.berkeley.edu/account-monitoring-and-management-guideline)__:
Account monitoring and management controls provide a gatekeeper function to prevent and detect unauthorized activities that may lead to loss of covered data.
When implemented correctly, these controls allow resource proprietors and resource custodians to control precisely who has access to covered data and detect inappropriately granted access before data loss events occur.

> Security administrator is the role of a user who is most likely to be responsible for user account management and reviews of audit data in a client/server architecture. Security administrators are responsible for overseeing systems security, such as the assignment of user accounts and the security settings of particular systems or applications, in a distributed computing system. A distributed system uses a client/server-style architecture in which clients that are connected to a server can also function independently of that server. Therefore, a client does not rely on a server to process information that is local to the client. As a result, the responsibility for securing the system must be shared between the client and the server. Although security administrators typically have lesser privileges than system administrators, they are usually responsible for auditing the actions of system administrators. Security administrators often work directly with system administrators and application administrators.

*Which of the following is not a use case for configuration management system (CMS) ?*

Of the available choices, attack prevention is not a use case for a CMS. Attack prevention is primarily a function of an intrusion prevention system (IPS). An IPS is different from an intrusion detection system (IDS) in that an IPS device is typically installed inline on a network. IPS devices attempt to take preventive and responsive actions against attacks by actively dropping malicious traffic; an IDS device can simply respond to the malicious traffic.

A CMS can be a manual configuration management process, an automated software tool, or something in between. Typically, a CMS is used to ensure that secure configurations are deployed on new systems and to ensure that secure configurations are not modified. However, a CMS can also be used for all of the following purposes:

* Service modeling and application mapping
* Compliance and standardization
* Incident resolution
* Change impact analysis
* Change control
* Event management
* License management
* Hardware asset management

__[RAID Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels)__ :
RAID 10 provides striping for a set of mirrored disks. RAID 10 is an example of nested RAID, which is the encapsulation of one RAID level into another RAID level. Therefore, RAID 10 is RAID 1 encapsulated with RAID 0, or a striped mirror.

RAID 0, which is also known as a striped set, doesn't provide mirroring. RAID 0 uses striping, which is a method of writing data across multiple hard disks to increase performance. Information on striped disks can be accessed faster than information on a single disk because reads occur in parallel rather than serially. RAID 0 can also increase write performance. However, striping doesn't provide fault tolerance because the data that is stored on one disk is not copied to other disks in a RAID 0 set. If one disk a RAID 0 array fails, the data must be restored from backup.

RAID 1 provides fault tolerance by using mirroring, but it does not provide increase write performance. Mirroring is the exact duplication of data on one disk to one or more other disks. Therefore, RAID 1 is also known as a mirrored set. If a disk in a RAID 1 set fails, a mirror of that disk can take its place so that no data is lost. RAID 1 can also increase read performance because data can be read simultaneously from multiple disks. However, write performance is generally slower than for a single disk because the data must be written multiple times.

Neither RAID 3 or RAID 4 provides striping for a set of mirrored disks. RAID 3 and 4 are both striped sets that use parity to provide fault tolerance. Parity, which is used to check whether data has been lost or written over when data is moved from one storage location to another, is a means of providing fault tolerance without using mirroring. RAID 3 stripes data at the byte level. RAID 4 stripes data at the block level. Both RAID 3 and 4 require at least three disks to function, and they each dedicate one entire disk for parity. If one disk in a RAID 3 or 4 array fails, the data can be recovered. However, if multiple disks in a RAID 3/4 array fail, the data must be restored from backup.

__Types of data backup__ :
* __Full__ : First backup that is performed in all backup schemes. During this process, a full backup clears the archive attribute for each file. The archive attribute enables backup programs to determine which files need to be backed up. When an existing file is changed again, the archive attribute is turned on again so that the file is included in the next backup operation.
* __Differential__ : only includes the files that have the archive attribute turned on, which indicates that they have been modified or created since the last full or incremental backup. Differential backups are typically performed between full backups to reduce time necessary to backup files. Differential backups do not clear the archive attribute, so each successive differential backup will typically be larger than the previous differential backup. Restoring data when using differential backups will take as long as or longer than restoring from a full backup because it requires both the full backup and the most current differential backup.
* __Incremental__ : are performed on weeknights. An incremental backup only backups files that have been modified since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups clear the archive attribute at the completion of the backup process. They provide the shortest backup creation time of all backup types because they backup the fewest files. However, restoring data from an incremental backup will take as long as or longer than restoring data from a full backup or a differential backup because it requires the full backup and each incremental backup created since the last full backup.
* __Copy__ : is similar to a full backup. In contrast to a full backup, it does not clear the archive attribute for each file. Because the archive attribute is used to determine whether a file needs to be backed up, a copy does not affect regularly scheduled backup operations. Typically, a copy is a manual process performed only when needed, such as immediately prior to scheduled maintenance or to create copies of data to be stored offsite.

__[Cloud computing deployment models](https://networkinterview.com/public-vs-private-vs-hybrid-vs-community-clouds/)__
*  __Community__ is a cloud computing deployment model that can use a mixture of public and private infrastructure resources. However, community clouds share the public infrastructure resources between multiple organizations. Typically, the organizations involved in community cloud computing have common needs that the community cloud can provide.
* __Private__ is a cloud computing deployment model that is constructed for only the organization that uses its services. Private cloud computing is typically established by using either a third-party service or internal servers, not both. The use of a private cloud enables an administrator to ensure that the cloud's resources are available only to an authorized few users. Therefore, private cloud computing is typically considered the lowest risk to security when a customer is adopting a cloud solution.
* __Public__ cloud is a cloud computing deployment model that is owned and operated by a service provider. Public clouds typically allow the general public to access storage and applications served from the cloud. For example, a Gmail account is a service that is provided from a public cloud. Other public cloud computing providers include Amazon and Rackspace.
* __Hybrid__ is a cloud computing deployment model that uses public resources on demand to extend its private infrastructure. Hybrid uses a mixture of private and public infrastructure resources to form a single organization's cloud.

__Types of IDS__ :
* An __anomaly-detection IDS__ requires that a baseline be taken before it can detect threats. Anomaly-detection IDSs detect abnormalities in network traffic behavior. To enable anomaly-detection devices to detect abnormalities in traffic, a baseline reading must first be taken to determine what normal network traffic patterns are like. Once the baseline is taken, an anomaly-detection device will compare future traffic against the baseline to detect abnormal traffic flows. Although anomaly-detection devices are good at detecting new attacks, they have a higher false positive rate than other types of IDS devices.
* A __pattern-matching IDS__, which is also called a signature-matching IDS, does not require that a baseline be taken before it can detect threats. Instead, a pattern-matching IDS uses specific strings of text called signatures to detect malicious traffic. The primary benefit of signature-matching detection methods is that the number of false positives generated is typically low. However, signature-matching detection methods do not provide adequate protection against new attacks. Although signatures can be added as new threats are found, there is always a delay between the time a threat is released and the time a signature is developed to detect the threat.
* A __protocol-behavior IDS__ does not require that a baseline be taken before it can detect threats. Instead, a protocol-behavior IDS uses rules to detect protocol traffic that does not follow standard methods of operation. The rules used by protocol-behavior devices are usually based on the Request for Comment (RFC) documents that define each protocol. Although protocol-behavior devices can detect nonstandard traffic, there is no way to know for sure whether the traffic is caused by a malicious user or by a poorly coded application. Therefore, protocol-behavior devices have a higher rate of false positives and they are not as good as anomaly-detection devices at detecting new threats.

>When a team of developers is developing an application, if the application is considered ready for production, then the code will be frozen. This is the __code freeze step__.

__[Types of application testing](https://www.soapui.org/testing-dojo/best-practices/#BoundaryTests)__

* __Automated Static Analysis__ : software testing mechanism that uses scripts to conduct passive tests against the software's compiled code.
* __Manual Dynamic Software Testing__ : examines running code to verify whether the information that is output from the software is valid based on the input.

*More testing types* :

* __Negative testing__ is the software testing technique that is most likely to use boundary tests. Negative testing is the process of issuing invalid information to an application to ensure that the application appropriately handles the input. Because negative testing attemps to test every type of invalid or incorrect input, the process can be laborious and is sometimes ignored in favor of releasing code that is known to work with correct input.
* __Boundary testing__ is a specific form of negative testing in which values that are known to be out of the range of accepted values are input into given form fields to determine whether the application handles such errors appropriately. For example, a field that should accept values in the range from 1 through 100 should appropriately generate an error if the user attempts to issue a negative integer, a value of 0 or a value greater than 100.
* __Positive testing__ is a form of software testing that is intended to determine whether an application is working as it is designed to work.
* __Scenario testing__ is a form of software testing that is intended to determine whether an application performs correctly given a particular use case.
* __CRUD testing__ is a form of software testing that is intended to ensure that database objects are being created correctly.


__[Obfuscation methods](https://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/10967/InTech-Theory_and_practice_of_program_obfuscation.pdf)__ :
* __Prevention obfuscation__ : attempts to make code obscure to computers. Prevention obfuscation makes it difficult for a computer to deobfuscate or to decompile the code. Examples of prevention obfuscation include inserting jerk bytes, converting branches to jsr instructions and combining try blocks with catch blocks.
* __Lexical obfuscation__ : deals with renaming classes, fields and methods, replacing them with new identifiers that lack intuitive meaning. For example, you could replace "salary" simply with the letter "a". Lexical obfuscators can reduce the size of an application. However, care must be taken when lexical obfuscators are implemented because all instances of a name must be replaced with the new identifier. Some standard classes cannot be obfuscated.
* __Data obfuscation__ : deals with modifying data and data structures in order to hide what the data is used for or what the structures do. Variable modification, array splitting and bit shifting can all be used to perform data obfuscation.
* __Control flow obfuscation__ : deals with making an application harder to understand or to decompile. This can be implemented by separating related structures and operations, grouping unrelated structures and operations, inserting unused or irrelevant code and creating parallel code.

__[Microsoft Testing](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/7100.the-security-development-lifecycle.aspx)__ : Microsoft SDL is a software development model that helps developers create secure software applications while keeping costs low. The SDL consists of the following seven phases :
* Training => consists of conducting core security training for software development team members.
* Requirements => during this phase, the development team will consider the level of security they seek to implement. This phase consists of :
    * Establish security requirements
    * Create quality gates and bug bars
    * Perform security and privacy risk assessments.
* Design => the following practices occur during this phase :
    * Establish design requirements
    * Perform attack surface analysis and reduction
    * Use threat modeling
* Implementation => during this phase, the team will create the software based on the blueprint they created in the design phase. Consists of :
    * Use approved tools
    * Deprecate unsafe functions
    * Perform static analysis
* Verification => team will ensure that the code meets the security standards they established during the requirements phase. Consists of :
    * Perform dynamic analysis
    * Perform fuzz testing
    * Conduct an attack surface review
* Release => team will make the software ready to be released. The team will also address ways to manage security concerns that might arise after the software is released. Consists of :
    * Create an incident response plan
    * Conduct a final security review
    * Certify the release and archive of the project materials
* Response => consists of everything that occurs after the software has been released. If a threat emerges, the team should execute the incident response plan that was created in the release phase.

__[Buffer overflow protections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/bb430720(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)__:
* __Pointer Encoding__ : Pointer Encoding is the buffer overflow protection mechanism that Microsoft recommends but does not require for ISVs who are implementing the SDL. Pointer Encoding is a buffer overflow protection mechanism that applies an exclusive OR (XOR) random value with pointers, encoding the pointer value. To exploit a pointer that has global scope, an attacker would need to overwrite the pointer with a value that is correctly encoded. Microsoft considers Pointer Encoding to be of moderate priority and a recommendation, but not a requirement, for Microsoft SDL. The SDL process is a Microsoft-recommended means of implementing security during the development of applications that run on Microsoft systems.
* __Heap Metadata Protection__ : Heap Metadata Protection is a buffer overflow protection mechanism that forces an application to fail immediately if a pointer is freed incorrectly. Heap Metadata Protection is one of several buffer overflow protection mechanisms that are available for developers who use Microsoft development tools. Of those mechanisms, Microsoft considers Heap Metadata Protection to be of moderate priority and a requirement for SDL.

>Application tampering is an instance in which for example a malicious user tries to access another user's profile on a website by manually adjusting a user ID number in the URL. It might be foiled by redirecting the malicious user to a 404 error page or by reloading the user's own profile page, in which case no error message appears. Detailed information about the tampering attempt is likely to be logged so that security personnal can review it and take appropriate action. Tampering is also least likely to generate user visible error messages.

__Object reuse__ : Object reuse is the process of using authentication credentials that an application or process has shared in memory to authenticate a user or another application or process. Gargabe collection is most likely to mitigate this threat.

__[Garbage Collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals)__ : is the process of cleaning up and controlling what is left in memory by an application; this process happens periodically as well as when that application is closed. Therefore, garbage collection ensures that credentials are released from memory when they are no longer required.

__ActiveX control__ : is a client-based technology that primarily uses a digital certificate as a security control. Unlike Java, which is an object-oriented programming language that is supported by a variety of platforms, ActiveX controls are browser applications that are supported only on the Microsoft Windows OS. Therefore, ActiveX can be used to download windows OS updates or perform other functions from the browser that are closely related to the OS.
