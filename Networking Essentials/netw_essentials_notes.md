# **Networking Essentials Notes**

### **Protocol Stack**

- **HTTP**
- **TCP**
- **IP**
- **Eth**

### **Protocol model**

Matches structure of a particular protocol suite.

### **Reference model**

Describes the functions that must be completed at a particular layer

### **TCP/IP model layer**

**Application** : represents data to the user, + encoding and data control
**Transport** : Supports comm between devices
**Internet** : Determines best path through network
**Network access** : Controls HW and media that make up the network

## **OSI Model Layer**

- **7 - Application** : The application layer contains protocols used for process to process communications
- **6 - Presentation** : Provides for common representation of the data transferred between app layer services
- **5 - Session** : Provides services to the presentation layer to organize its layer and manage data exchange
- **4 - Transport** : Defines services to segment, transfer and reassemble the data for individual communications between devices
- **3 - Network** : Provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network between identified devices
- **2 - Data Link** : Describes methods for exchanging data frames between devices
- **1 - Physical** : Describes the mechanical, electrical, functional and procedural means to activate, maintain and de-activate physical connection
